       "  'content': 'How software and AI are becoming the brain of telecom networks to reinforce digital businesses. 5G is the common denominator behind digitalisation and automation, the connected world, and smart enterprises. While industries are transforming and automating at an unheralded pace, 5G service providers are being plunged into the role of agents for the success of those industries, and not without benefits – there are massive monetisation opportunities for service providers. A digital economy worth almost a trillion dollars hinges on the capability of the underpinning networks to deliver. But to unlock the network’s full potential, telcos might want to take a leaf from the hyperscalers and their use of automation and intelligence technologies. And while billions are being spent on the development of IoT, Industry 4.0 and the connected world, far less is devoted to the automation and intelligent technologies that could enhance the quality and reliability of the telecom networks that will form the backbone of the new trillion-dollar economy. Telecom networks need to offer advanced connectivity services that are on-demand and delivered in real-time with unprecedented availability and quality of service. The expected experience of the enterprise user is a swift response, and the expected behaviour of the enterprise user – similar to a hyperscaler company’s user – is the choice to churn between networks when services don’t perform. Enterprise users would expect that guaranteed SLAs for use-cases, such as connected vehicles, industrial processes and remote healthcare are always met. SLA guarantees are mostly integral to the enterprise’s business model, and to make the model work, telcos will need to work doubly hard. While 5G networks promise a high level of response and service using network slicing, edge connectivity and private networks , they still lag in offering automation and intelligence, important for high agility and assure the promises are maintained over time. By introducing these, telco network efficiency would increase by an order of magnitude, reinforcing service provider business. As billions of new devices are added and use cases from multiple industries boom, 5G networks are under huge pressure to manage the complexity, scale and speed of Industry 4.0 and smart enterprise services. 5G networks need to be fully autonomic to deal with this challenge. The term autonomic relates to an automated, intelligent, predictive, and experience-driven way of operating the network. This is missing today. A higher level of intelligence is required to deal with the immense complexity, scale and diversity of devices and use-cases powered by the network, that goes beyond the precision required to run the network efficiently and effectively. The 5G network of today has become highly disaggregated (Open RAN, VRAN, CRAN, Edge, etc.) and the intelligence is now delegated to the edge and private access networks. Assuring services now requires a system that uses AI to deal with the diverse and distributed nature of 5G; to act as the nerve centre of the network and command its mission-critical and business-reinforcing operations. This will lead the modern 5G (and future connectivity technologies) to the reality of an autonomic telco network. The autonomic network will be realised only if AI is used to assure its agile operations and to produce intelligent analytics to ensure that business problems are immediately and accurately resolved. Since service providers are quickly embracing a collaborative approach to co-innovating and co-creating services using AI for operations and analytics, this is the perfect time for them to collaborate with assurance vendors to enrich the service provider’s telco data lakes, which will guarantee a high degree of accuracy on the AI/ML models. This democratisation of access to network data through a BRAIN system will allow service providers to innovate faster. BRAIN is not only about the use of AI to assure future networks intelligently and for their autonomic operations. It is a powerful concept to reinforce and realise business objectives, as billions of dollars are being spent on making Industry 4.0 a success. The components of BRAIN are intelligent software (service assurance), big data, AI, cloud and open API. The BRAIN is an enabler of several capabilities (including real-time orchestration, automation, and analytics) that enables service providers to ensure high performance and reliability for Industry 4.0 and private mobile networks. Having served tier-one telcos around the world for the past two decades, MYCOM OSI has embarked on an exciting new journey of building the BRAIN for public and private mobile networks through collaborative work across the industry. MYCOM OSI plays a key role in bringing the concept to the real world. Working with an ecosystem of hyperscalers, technology companies and system integrators, the BRAIN will enable the democratisation of the network data that is critical for the success of tomorrow’s autonomic telcos, private mobile networks, and smart enterprise networks. *BRAIN (Business Reinforcement using Artificial Intelligence for Networks) is a MYCOM OSI concept.

       "  'content': 'Digital-fast brands turn to scalable content strategies to meet modern customer expectations. The customer experience is now digital. Today, 58 per cent of customer interactions around the world are digital, according to a report from McKinsey & Company. This tells businesses that digital transformation isn’t just coming – it’s already happened. The digitised world has changed two fundamental elements of the customer experience: speed and proximity. As Contentful CEO, Steve Sloan, puts it, “The distance between customer and brand has been reduced to a matter of pixels, and immediacy is the only timeframe customers are willing to accept.” In this modern marketplace, the challenge for all businesses – century-old heritage brands and direct-to-consumer disruptors alike – is translating the dynamic experiences customers appreciate from in-person interactions into the pace and proximity they expect from digital. This digital-ﬁrst and digital-fast environment has positioned content as the foundation of the customer experience. Content is the way brands package up their stories to educate, inform and inspire. Content is also how brands deliver experiences across all the digital channels, devices and environments customers now frequent. Scalable content powers the modern customer experience In-person customer interactions enforce a predictable pace for commerce. There are literal front doors and sales representatives to manage and respond to customer needs. The digital world, on the other hand, has many entry points: mobile devices, apps, smart speakers, digital kiosks, wearables and a slew of emerging technologies. To keep up with this demand for content distribution, brands have relied on traditional content delivery strategies like legacy content management systems (CMS), product information management systems (PIM) or digital asset management systems (DAM). Traditional delivery strategies have been an effective stopgap for companies trying to push content out across a ﬁnite number of channels such as websites and apps. However, as digital customer touchpoints proliferate, these vertical-focused solutions now create siloes that trap content within different management systems and force digital teams to rely on manual copy and pasting efforts to reuse their content. The second challenge of single-purpose solutions, like monolithic CMSs, is rigidity. Monolithic systems can be described as opinionated technology that forces businesses to create digital solutions reflecting the tool rather than the customer. When faced with digital customers’ new demand for customisable experiences, monolithic solutions start to show their fragility. For years, siloed content and fragile monolithic solutions have been accepted as the reality for businesses operating in the digital era. However, leading brands are now turning to content platforms such as Contentful that offer ﬂexibility and scalability through an API-ﬁrst approach. An API (application programming interface) allows devices to communicate directly with each other, going from human to machine scale. With an API-ﬁrst approach, content platforms remove internal content siloes by emphasising, not restricting, the integration of content across a brand’s tech stack. This gives brands the freedom to develop the best content experience for their customers today and evolve their strategies by integrating new tools in the future. Taking an API-ﬁrst approach to content allows brands to embed their content management and delivery into whichever technology stack they prefer, meaning they aren’t tied to any one particular system or solution. This ensures digital experiences are tailored to business and customer needs rather than technological capabilities. By adopting a platform approach to content, leading businesses are using content as the foundation for customised customer experiences that don’t drain internal time and resources. In response to customer demand for video doctor appointments due to Covid-19, Livi, a medical app owned by healthcare company Kry International AB, launched a global telehealth product in just four weeks. To deliver on this experience, Livi needed to build out a country-speciﬁc website for each of its markets, comply with local regulations and deliver services in the appropriate language while keeping its brand identity consistent across all channels. To deliver on the speed and scale of this project, Livi used Contentful’s content platform. Contentful’s modular content system allowed Livi developers to build the technological capabilities necessary to deliver the new telehealth services reliably, while also enabling content creators to update and publish medical information across the services swiftly. Contentful’s API-ﬁrst approach then allowed the Livi team to integrate their site with a translation and localisation tool, making it possible to launch the service in 10 languages in just four weeks. In the world of retail, Matches Fashion, a well-established curator of luxury men’s and women’s clothing and home goods, shows how a brand that once relied on in-person interaction is now delivering engaging digital experiences to its customers. The company originally started more than 30 years ago as a brick-and-mortar business, but today is driving 95 per cent of its revenue from online sales. This move to digital involves shipping products to customers in 176 different countries, processing different currencies across regions and maintaining websites and apps in four different languages. To keep pace with the content demands at each of these new digital customer touchpoints, Matches Fashion used Contentful’s content platform to reduce the marketing team’s reliance on their technical colleagues while still delivering the customised experiences their customers expected. To support the need for fresh and relevant content, the engineering team designed a host of content models, including homepages, articles and campaign banners, that integrated across the business’ expanding digital channels. With these content models in place, the marketing team was able to edit and publish content autonomously whenever it needed to. According to Matches Fashion’s trading and campaigns manager, “Contentful has been game-changing... it has allowed us to be more ﬂexible and reactive than ever before with our marketing content and has streamlined processes for multiple teams across the business.” Brands across every industry are learning how to use a platform-ﬁrst approach to deliver engaging digital customer experiences.

       "  'content': 'Older workers may fall out of the jobs market altogether as furlough ends, according to a new report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), and economic think tank.  The £70 billion government scheme which was meant to mitigate the sudden and severe unemployment triggered by lockdowns during the pandemic comes to an end on Thursday. UK job vacancies have hit record levels, with more than hitting more than 1 million for the first time on record. There were 1.6 million people still on full or parttime furlough in July.  Now, economists are trying to work out what will happen to those workers who will be left without the support of furlough. Several note a mismatch between the location of new jobs and where workers live, and also with workers professional experience and the sectors where roles are being created. The IFS has warned that furloughed older workers are a “particular group of concern”. Nearly 400,000 workers who were still on furlough in June were aged 50 or over. These workers find it harder to find new work once made redundant, according to the IFS. Workers from 18-49 had a 64 per cent probability of finding a new job after being laid off during the coronavirus crisis, compared with 35 per cent for the over 50s.  Older workers, aged 60-plus were not only less likely to find a new job, but also likely to stop hunting fresh opportunities falling out of the workforce entirely, this effect became permanent in the US after the 2008-2009 recession, the IFS said. A significant proportion of older furloughed workers are in industries which are not the most exposed to lockdowns such as entertainment and hospitality. This means that they are more likely not to be return to their old jobs once the scheme ends. A significant proportion are also likely to be the only bread-winner in their household. “We ought to be doubly concerned about these workers: not only are they more likely to be made redundant, they are also more likely to have persistently low living standards should they lose their job”, the IFS said. Still, the support offered by government is skewed more toward younger workers’ return to employment.  The best route scheme for older workers is the ‘Restart’ scheme, which is available to people who have been claiming Universal Credit and unemployed for 12-18 months. But this doesn’t address the problem of workers who become inactive, and fail to qualify for Universal Credit or the new job seekers allowance. If older workers do leave furlough to then get some support from universal credit, they would not be eligible for Restart until October 2022 at the earliest, risking fading skills and a loss of confidence. Younger workers, who are now getting jobs at a similar rate to before the pandemic can also draw on the Kickstart Scheme which offers funding to employers who hire 16 to 24 year olds on Universal Credit. Jonathan Cribb, a Senior Research Economist at IFS and an author of the report, said: “Recessions always create risks for older workers, particularly because if older workers lose their jobs there is a risk they may never return to work. Unfortunately, there is evidence that may be happening now.  “The chances of over-60s finding new work within six months of redundancy have plummeted and the majority of those older workers that lost their jobs during the pandemic were not actively searching for work. Given this, the government should consider opening its ‘Restart’ scheme to all people out of work, not just those on universal credit,” he said. A government spokesperson said that there were nearly two million fewer people are now expected to be out of work than was previously feared. The added that it was the right time to “naturally” wind down the furlough scheme, adding there were “194,000 more people aged 50-64 on payrolls compared to a year ago”.  There is some specific advice for older workers provided by the government they said, adding that it was “giving people of all ages the skills and opportunities they need to get back into work”.

This\\xa0plan was created\\xa0specifically with adversaries Russia\\xa0and China, and their cyber-hostility in mind, according to\\xa0a person\\xa0briefed on the plan. It comes as the UK has sought to further cement its close security ties with Washington, via the tripartite nuclear submarine deal with the US and Australia termed ‘Aukus’ in recent weeks. The agreement is part of the wider effort to “preserve security and stability in the Indo-Pacific,” prime minister Boris Johnson said in a statement earlier this month which avoided a direct reference to China.

       "  'content': 'Intel says Brexit means it is no longer considering the UK as the site to build a major new chip factory as part of its $95bn (£70bn) global expansion plans. Pat Gelsinger, the chief executive of the world’s largest maker of semiconductors, said they were now only considering European Union member states to host a new European site. Intel is planning to invest £70bn in infrastructure over the next 10 years to boost its output by setting up new semiconductor plants. The company said that the US and Europe were too dependent on Asia for their chips and rival manufacturers continue to expand in countries such as South Korea and Taiwan. “I have no idea whether we would have had a superior site from the UK,” Mr Gelsinger told BBC News. “But we now have about 70 proposals for sites across Europe from maybe 10 different countries. We’re hopeful that we’ll get to agreement on a site, as well as support from the EU... before the end of this year.” The Intel boss said that the company is hoping to secure subsidies from governments in the US and European countries on the basis that dependency on Asia for microchips could threaten their national security. “It is clearly part of the motivation of a globally balanced supply chain that nobody should be too dependent on somebody else,” Mr Gelsinger said. The company’s plans for expansion in the EU market come amid a global shortage of semiconductors, which is affecting the supply chains of all kinds of goods, from cars to computers, inflating the prices of many goods where microchips are vital components. Mr Gelsinger said that the crisis might continue until Christmas and that while they were “working like crazy to catch up, it’s going to be a while”. Things may improve slightly next year but it would take until 2023 for the situation to fully stabilise, he said. Being ousted from Intel’s expansion plans is not the only fallout Britain has suffered due to the country’s departure from the European Union.\\xa0Dozens of companies in the UK had cut jobs, beefed up their European operations or issued warnings on the impact of Brexit even before the final deal came into effect on 31 January last year. In January 2019, the British bank Barclays moved £166bn of its clients’ assets to Dublin, saying that it could not wait any longer to implement Brexit contingency plans. As of last year at least 140 companies had moved to the Netherlands since the 2016 Brexit referendum, according to the Netherlands’ Foreign Investment Agency.

       "  'content': \"Accounting and consulting firm PwC has decided to permanently allow its 40,000 client-service employees in the US to work remotely from anywhere. PwC’s new policy will allow the majority of its 55,000 American employees to work virtually if they want. The company's support staff and employees in areas such as human resources and legal were earlier allowed to work virtually full time. The remote-work policy is a tectonic shift from the accounting industry’s traditional work culture that encourages people to put in overtime and work in the office till late at night. “We’re confident we can manage hybrid teams,” said PwC's deputy people leader Yolanda Seals-Coffield, claiming the firm was the first in the accounting industry to make full-time virtual work available to client-service employees. Ms Seals-Coffield insisted that the employees who choose to work virtually would have to come to the office a maximum of three days a month for appointments, client visits and team meetings. However, employees who opt to work virtually full-time from a lower-cost location would be subjected to a pay cut, she added. Alphabet Inc‘s Google also bases employees’ pay on their location, with those who work from home subject to reduced income. “We have learned a ton through the pandemic, and working virtually, as we think about the evolution of flexibility, is a natural next step. If you are an employee in good standing, are in client services, and want to work virtually, you can, full stop,” Ms Seals-Coffield was quoted as saying by Reuters. PwC’s research suggested 30 to 35 per cent of its eligible workers will take the firm up on the offer, according to Ms Seals-Coffield. In June this year, PwC said it would hire 100,000 people over the next five years in jobs that would help clients report on diversity and climate. The firm currently employs 284,000 globally. Other accounting firms such as Deloitte and KPMG have also given their employees the choice to work remotely amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Deloitte’s chief executive Richard Houston said the firm’s 20,000-strong workforce will be able to choose when, where and how they work in the future.

       "  'content': 'The UK economy recovered faster than expected between April and June this year as spending surged after lockdown.  The Office for National Statistics said that gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 5.5 per cent in the second quarter of the year, after being revised up from the initial estimation of 4.8 per cent.  Shops reopening and a return to eating out helped fuel the upward GDP revision, with household spending contributing four percentage points of the 5.5 per cent increase. The bounce-back recovery has slowed down in recent months, however, with economic growth easing to only 0.1 per cent in July. This was a drop from 1.4 per cent growth in June.  Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the ONS, explained the new figures, saying: “The economy grew more in the second quarter than previously estimated, with the latest data showing health services and the arts performing better than initially thought.  “The revised figures also show households have been saving less in recent years than previously thought.  “Household saving fell particularly strongly in the latest quarter from the record highs seen during the pandemic, as many people were again able to spend on shopping, eating out and driving their cars.” The upward revision of GDP growth will bring the UK economy’s performance in line with that of other G7 countries, said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.  The gap between current growth levels and the pre-pandemic peak is now the same as in Germany, similar to the 3.2 per cent shortfall in France, and slightly better than the 3.8 per cent shortfall seen in Italy, The Financial Times reported.  The UK’s rebound recovery still lags behind the US economy however.  Household spending jumped 7.9 per cent in the second quarter, while the savings ratio fell to 11.7 per cent from 18.4 per cent in the first three months of 2021.  The current supply chain crisis and lorry driver shortage has provoked The Bank of England to slash its expectations for economic growth in the third quarter of this year from 2.9 per cent to 2.1 per cent.  The new statistics come as nearly 1 million workers are expected to be booted off the furlough scheme on Thursday.  Fidelity International’s investment director, Maike Currie, said that “no one really knows what is next”. She added: “I think what we can be certain of is that we’ll see under-employment, where employees return to work but possibly not on a full-time basis and that they might need to supplement their income.” Employers should not expect the rush of workers coming off furlough to be able to help the supply chain crisis, one analyst warned.  Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “Any hope that the end of the furlough scheme might be the magic wand to solve the supply chain crisis is likely to be wishful thinking.” CEO of retailers association UK Hospitality, Kate Nicholls, warned that post-pandemic workers will be selective about the jobs they pick.  She said: “Covid is providing the hospitality sector with a reset moment and we are looking at ways of working, hours and conditions. As people come back from furlough they are more selective about what they want to do and more demanding as employees.  “It’s about making sure that we look after our people because they are our most valued and valuable resource and we need to make sure that they can be as comfortable as possible at work.” Additional reporting from wires Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies Getty/iStock Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

       "  'content': 'The Port of Los Angeles and some of the nation’s largest carriers of commercial freight will begin operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week as part of a White House-led push to clear a massive backlog of unloaded shipping in time for the holiday shopping season. According to a senior White House official, the Port of Los Angeles’ efforts will be augmented by workers at FedEx, Wal-Mart, and UPS moving to 24-hour operations as well.  Additionally, the White House will be looking to other transportation providers to do the same in order to maximise capabilities nationwide and avoid supply chain bottlenecks that have many experts warning of shortages during one of the peak seasons for US retail businesses. The Port of Los Angeles is the largest port in all of North America, spanning over 7,500 acres and containing 25 separate cargo terminals. The 3,200-acre Port of Long Beach is the second largest, and has been operating 24 hours a day for several weeks. Combined, the two ports handle nearly half of all cargo entering for the United States, including containers from America’s largest trading partners such as China, Japan, and South Korea. Both have seen record numbers of ships waiting to be unloaded in recent days due to pandemic-era changes in labour supply and shopping practices. White House officials are hoping the move to all-day, all-night operations across the supply chain will help clear shipping and supply bottlenecks. Other companies joining the push to expand operations are Samsung, Target, and Home Depot. “We need the private sector to step and help solve these problems,” said a White House official who briefed reporters on the announcement, which is scheduled to take place during a Wednesday afternoon virtual roundtable with President Joe Biden and leaders from across the shipping industry. The official said the White House is hoping that more and more shipping and logistics providers will join those that have already made the commitment to move to non-stop operations, because such commitments are most effective “when every private company along the supply chain does the same thing”. “We will be looking to trucking and freight to expand hours as well to help with the bottlenecks,” the official said.  “We will be working across the supply chain for a 90-day sprint to the end of the year”.

       "  'content': 'Business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has promised that the price cap will remain this winter amid pressure from energy firms. Mr Kwarteng said Britain will not run out of gas this winter and keeping the energy cap in place was “non-negotiable” after some firms call for a price hike to prevent more collapses as wholesale gas prices soar.  The vow comes as leaders in the heavy industry have warned of factories halting production if rising gas prices are not brought under control. Current wholesale gas prices are at £2.50 per therm while the price cap is holding domestic consumer prices at 65p a therm.  Amid the growing uncertainty of the energy crisis, Boris Johnson reportedly flew to Marbella to holiday in a private villa on the Costa del Sol. Downing Street did not deny reports he had travelled to Spain, and declined to say whether the prime minister was working at No 10 or in Chequers, as is commonplace. “The safety net that we have in place to shield consumers from instant price hikes this Christmas, and ensure everyone gets the supply they need,” Mr Kwarteng told the Sunday Express.  “Because that’s always my first, main concern,” he added. “Protecting consumers and particularly those on lower incomes. Despite some who are pushing me to lift the cap, I am absolutely clear it is here to stay and will remain at the same level throughout winter.” Energy suppliers criticised the energy price cap on Saturday, saying it will not protect households from an expected rise in costs. Paul Richards, the chief executive of Together Energy, which he said was currently running at a loss, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “The price cap as a mechanism is not fit for industry, nor is it fit for customers. Energy regulator Ofgem also said that customers can expect a “significant rise” in energy prices this April. Mr Richards said while the energy cap protected customers in the short-term, there was between £1bn and £3bn in costs as a result of failed suppliers that would be placed upon businesses and households. Utilita Energy’s non-executive chairman Derek Lickorish said: “The cap is not fit for purpose. “There is no doubt that there is going to be a huge cost paid by customers for failed suppliers... certainly well over £100 million for every 200,000 customers that fail. “The Government has to look at means by which they can support not only energy suppliers but also big industry.” Despite holding talks with business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng on Friday, industry leaders have said no immediate solutions or commitments were reached.

       "  'content': 'Trading in shares of China’s troubled real estate giant Evergrande was suspended on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) on Monday, as the world’s most indebted developer missed back-to-back interest payment deadlines and continues its attempts to pay off investors.  “Trading in the shares of China Evergrande Group will be halted at 9am today,” a regulatory filing with HKEX said, without stating a reason. “Accordingly, all structured products relating to the company will also be halted from trading at the same time.” HKEX did not specify the reasons behind the halt or who initiated the suspension. However, it has intensified speculation over a potential acquisition in the company’s property management unit, as the cash-strapped company has been making attempts to raise money to meet its dues. Cailian, a Chinese online news service affiliated with the state-run newspaper Securities Times, said another developer, Hopson Development Holdings, was planning to acquire a majority share in Evergrande Property Services Group. Trading in Hopson’s shares was also suspended on Monday in Hong Kong, “pending the release of announcement(s) in relation to a major transaction of the company under which the company agreed to acquire the shares of a company... listed on the stock exchange,” it said in a filing. It is not clear yet whether Hopson’s acquisition announcement relates to Evergrande. However, Reuters has reported that the Chinese government – which has so far steered clear of helping one of the country’s most important developers with a bailout – is hoping that asset purchases can be a way out for the company.  As China’s second biggest developer, Evergrande is often said to be “too big” for the country to let it collapse. However, with a debt of $300bn (£221bn), the company is embroiled in a major crisis, missing interest payment dates and seeing its stock value tumble over 80 per cent in the last year.  The hugely indebted property giant missed another interest payment for an offshore bond last week, a second default in the same month. It was due to pay foreign bond holders $47.5m (£35m) by Wednesday. However, the company provided some relief to stock market investors who are fearing the domino effect of Evergrande’s collapse on Chinese and global markets, when it settled payment of one domestic bond earlier and sold a $1.5bn stake in a regional Chinese bank last week.  “Looks like the property management unit is the easiest to dispose [of] in the grand scheme of things, indicative of the company trying to generate near-term cash,” OCBC analyst Ezien Hoo told Reuters. “I’m not sure this necessarily means that the company has given up on surviving, especially as selling an asset means they are still trying to raise cash to pay the bills.” According to Reuters, the push from the authorities has worked and a handful of government-owned enterprises have already done due diligence on Evergrande’s assets in the southern Chinese city Guangzhou.  Potential buyers of Evergrande’s core assets in Guangzhou have been “arranged” with “both political and commercial considerations” in mind, Reuters quoted a source as saying, adding that authorities don’t want to see just a few companies bidding for the same assets.

       "  'content': 'Energy regulator Ofgem has warned of “significant” price rises and more company failures in the light of soaring gas prices.  Speaking at the Energy UK conference on Thursday, Ofgem CEO Jonathan Brearley said that customers will face “an extremely difficult time” as rising costs “are ultimately passed through to bills”.  He also warned that the price cap is likely to increase, saying that “it is designed to reflect fair costs and therefore will need to adjust over time to reflect the changes in fuel prices”. European natural gas prices shot to record highs this week following fears of supply shortages over the winter.  Speaking at what he said was an “unprecedented” time for the energy market, Mr Brearley said that more company failures were to be expected.  He said that the industry had already seen twelve companies fail and that “given the continued volatility of the market, it is likely that more suppliers will exit.” He added: “I appreciate the difficulties of those working in those companies and for their customers.” The default tariff cap set by regulator Ofgem is currently set at £1,277, but many industry experts are expecting this to increase when it is updated next year.  Mr Brearley signaled that customers will see a jump in the energy price cap, saying: “While gas prices remain high, the cap will inevitably need to reflect them to allow suppliers to recover their costs. But it is still protecting millions of customers from the full impact and pace of the rising costs of the prices that we are seeing today.” He also said that Ofgem would be taking more steps to regulate the market, in the light of many companies struggling to deal with gas price hikes. He promised to build a market that is “more resilient” to the volatility that has been seen over the past few months.  This would involve continuing to limit the number of new entrants to the sector. The CEO also said that it would be necessary to “diversify” the country’s sources of energy and highlighted an over-dependence on gas.  Speaking in a later panel event, director of policy and regulation at energy supplier EDF, Rebecca Sedler, said the recent crisis had been “a big wake up call”.  She said the UK had taken security in its energy supply “for granted more than other countries have done”.  Ms Sedler added that the UK needed more nuclear energy production and should “diversify” and become less dependent on gas.  Clementine Cowton, director of external affairs at Octopus Energy Group, a renewable energy supplier, said the national grid was running like a “minicab office” when it should be running like Uber.  She said: “We are still running the grid through phone calls and pulling levers and pushing buttons. We need to be digitising that infrastructure.”  Their comments come as the head of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, said that Russia has the capacity to send substantially more gas to Europe to help alleviate the energy crisis.  Speaking to the Financial Times, Mr Birol said that Russia could increase its exports by around 15 per cent of peak winter supply, and that this move could “have a calming effect on the market”.

The Petrol Retail Association (PRA) said its daily poll showed 13 per cent of independent retailers in the capital and southeast - the region worst hit by the crisis - were still dry on Wednesday. The figure is an improvement on Tuesday’s 15 per cent and Sunday’s 22 per cent, however some forecourts have been left waiting four days for delivery. Gordon Balmer, executive director of the PRA, said: “This is leaving some motorists continuing to feel insecure about fuel availability at their local neighbourhood filling stations. “Independent forecourts report a complete lack of visibility as to when their next delivery might arrive, and some have been dry for four days and still waiting for a delivery. “We have yet to see any explanation from the government of the benefits arising from the suspension of competition law between the major oil companies in the delivery of downstream fuel. “We need to restore a competitive market with incentives for those who deliver on the job.” Mr Balmer said some businesses had been forced to throw away fresh produce as the ongoing fuel crisis had also caused shop sales to plummet by between 20 and 50 per cent. “Most independent retailers have built a reputation with their local customers for reliable service, good facilities and a well-stocked convenience store,” he said.

       "  'content': 'Supermarkets are searching for alternative ways to bring food into Britain as ships are diverted from the UK’s main port due to congestion.  The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said “further disruption” to supply chains may be “unavoidable” after Maersk, the world’s largest container shipping company, said that it was directing big vessels away because main UK ports are chock-a-block. The congestion is down to a lack of HGV drivers available to move the unloaded containers to free up space.  On a visit to an HGV training centre near Oldham in Greater Manchester, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the shortage was “absolutely foreseeable”. “We knew when we left the EU that we would need to have a plan B in relation to drivers, we knew because of the pandemic there would be an impact, and here we are in the middle of a crisis and we’ve got, what? A prime minister who’s missing in action.” Mr Starmer was also caught on camera struggling in an attempt at driving a HGV. After hitting a barrier while reversing the lorry, the Labour MP was told that he would have failed his driving test.  “Well, it’s a big beast, is the lorry, but it was really interesting to drive it. I’m not sure that I’ll be driving to Tesco later on this afternoon to do the deliveries,” Sir Keir told broadcasters. Maersk has said that it has started to reroute bigger ships away from Felixstowe port in Suffolk, the gate way for 36 per cent of the country’s shipping containers. Instead, goods destined for the UK are being transferred onto small ships, delaying the time it takes for things to arrive.  Lars Mikael Jensen, head of global ocean network at Maersk, told the Financial Times on Monday: “We had to stop operations on a ship because there was nowhere to discharge the containers.  “Felixstowe is among the top two or three worst-hit terminals [globally]. We are having to deviate some of the bigger ships away from Felixstowe and relay some of the smaller ships for the cargo.” He added: “We did it for a little while over the summer and now we’re starting to do it again.” The BRC said on Tuesday that the congestion at Felixstowe was another consequence of the ongoing HGV driver shortage. Andrew Opie, the organisation’s director of food and sustainability, explained: “As cargo cannot be removed fast enough, there is a backlog of containers at the ports which are preventing new ships from docking and unloading.” The organisation, which counts most high street retailers and supermarkets as members, said that “retailers are working closely with suppliers to mitigate issues, including finding alternative routes to bring good into the country, but further disruption may be unavoidable.” They called on the government to extend the temporary visa scheme to increase the pool of available HGV drivers.  The trade body for UK port operators also said on Tuesday that some ports are managing storage space with “short-term restrictions”.  Tim Morris, chief executive of the UK Major Ports Group (UKMPG), said: “As the UK’s gateways for 95 per cent of trade, ports are the jam in the sandwich between surging, volatile shipping and UK supply chains badly impacting by factors such as HGV driver shortages.” He said that ports are now working 24/7 and have increased capacity for trucks in a bid to help ease pressures.  He added: “Ports therefore have to manage access to storage space very dynamically in extreme situations. This can mean some very limited short-term restrictions.” Trade magazine, The Grocer, reported that many shipping containers at Felixstowe are now spending around 10 days at the port before being collected, up from a typical average of four-and-a-half days.  Tesco has already said that it has increased its use of rail freight to try and reduce the impact of driver shortages on stock.  Chief executive, Ken Murphy, said that the supermarket had set a target of delivering 90,000 40ft containers of good a year via trains by the end of 2021, up from about 65,000 at the moment.

       "  'content': 'The government should consider a single carbon tax if it wants to get serious on tackling climate change, according to think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). Moving the economy to net zero – emitting less carbon dioxide than it consumes – will be messy and expensive unless the government has a radical rethink about how to simplify its approach to taxing greenhouse gas production, according fresh research from the IFS, Nuffield Foundation and Citibank. It comes as debate rages over how and who the country will pay for its ambitious climate goals. MPs across the political spectrum are concerned that taxes on carbon-intensive products or higher energy bills to support the move to renewables will fall on the shoulders of those least able to afford it. Yet reforming the tax system and policies to support a more coherent approach to cutting carbon will be a challenge, the IFS said.  “However, the government chooses to incentivise greater emissions reductions, close attention should be paid to the distributional consequences,” said Isaac Delestre, research economist at the IFS. “Compensation will likely be needed for some groups who will inevitably lose out from higher carbon prices.” Repeated failures to tackle the way households use energy by installing energy-saving home improvements such as insulation had also proved “short lived and ineffective”, the think tank said. These failures have been “exacerbating the problems of the current gas price surge”, it added.  So stark is the potential hit to poorer households from the drive to go green that the government may even have to consider using the revenues from green taxes to boost benefit payments, the IFS said. Current policies also have “wildly inconsistent incentives”, with end-users let off the hook for their consumption relative to the costs faced by those who directly emit greenhouse gases. An example of this, the IFS found, is how electricity production and road fuel are taxed more heavily than personal flights, where emissions are “effectively subsidised”.  “The government could look to replace the raft of existing policies with a single carbon tax, or with an extended emissions trading scheme that covered all emissions,” said Mr Delestre. “There would be major benefits to moving at least some way towards a simpler set of policies,” he added. While the UK has made progress on its green targets, with emissions made within the country falling by 38 per cent between 1990 and 2018, aviation’s carbon output has grown fiercely. Emissions from international flights more than doubled between 1990 and 2018. The offshoring, or carbon leakage effect, of carbon-intensive products from overseas also gives a false impression of what net zero means in a globalised economy.  Like other territories, such as the EU, the UK will have to consider placing a carbon tax on imported goods, something that is politically fraught for its international relations. Such a step is one way to address the inconsistency of trying to cut carbon emitted on UK soil while ignoring the wider environmental impact of the country’s consumption, the IFS said. “Reaching net zero will require faster emissions reductions in politically challenging areas, where incentives to cut emissions are relatively weak, and where progress to date has been particularly slow, including home heating, agriculture and aviation,” said Peter Levell, associate director at the IFS.

       "  'content': 'The price of natural gas in the UK and across Europe surged to a record high in several contracts on Tuesday afternoon as the market faced a “perfect storm” of cold weather, supply concerns and increased demand. The November gas price at the Dutch TTF hub, a European benchmark, traded at a record €120.80 per megawatt on Tuesday afternoon - a rise of more than 26 per cent on the day before. In the UK, wholesale gas prices for delivery in November increased by 14 per cent and peaked at £2.79 per therm. Meanwhile, prices for immediate delivery rose by 23 per cent to £2.50 per therm. It marked a 32 per cent increase on Monday’s close and surpassed the previous £2.75 per therm high in March 2018 when a large anticyclone, nicknamed the ‘Beast from the East’, sent temperatures plunging. The rise in gas prices has been blamed on a number of factors, including a cold winter that left stocks depleted, high demand for liquefied natural gas from Asia as countries emerge from Covid lockdowns and a reduction in supplies from Russia. Nine British gas companies were last month forced into administration due to the price surge, leaving hundreds of thousands of Britons facing higher tariffs. The price hike has sparked fears that a cost of living crisis looms for many families this winter.  OGUK, representing the offshore oil and gas industry, reported that wholesale prices for gas have surged 250 per cent since January - with a 70 per cent rise since August alone. Kwasi Kwarteng, the business minister, has faced criticism for prioritising the fate of larger energy suppliers. Speaking to Sky News last month, Mr Kwarteng said that the government was considering “a lot of options” to protect suppliers, including state-backed loans, but stressed that not all firms would benefit from emergency measures.  When a supplier fails, energy regulator Ofgem moves customers to another retailer to ensure that supplies continue and they do not lose money. A new supplier is then responsible for taking any credit balances a customer may have from their previous account. Though the government imposes a price cap on suppliers to prevent them from overcharging customers, it is expected that the current cap will be lifted by ministers after the next review - with households likely to face higher bills as a result. Vis Raghavan, JPMorgan Chase & Co’s top executive in Europe, told Bloomberg on Monday that the energy market is facing a “perfect storm” and there was “no certainty on when oil and gas prices will recover”. Other industry leaders have claimed that the turbulence in the global energy market will eventually pass. “It might take a while, but the market will stabilise at sensible levels,” De la Rey Venter, executive vice president at LNG West, which handles Shell’s natural gas assets around the world, told a virtual conference on Tuesday.

Speaking at Energy UK’s conference on Thursday, business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng repeated his pledge to “not bail out failing companies”. He said “they cannot be rewarded for irresponsible management of business”. However Mr Kwarteng admitted that the sector “may well see companies going out of the market” in the near future, saying “it’s going to be a difficult time”.  Opening the conference, chief executive of Energy UK, Emma Pinchbeck, warned that “we’ll see more businesses fail in the coming weeks”. Speaking about the recent energy crisis, she said: “I don’t think we are by many means through this period… it’s an extraordinary time.” Their comments come in light of a new report about the state of the country’s energy supply from the National Grid.  The electricity system operator said on Thursday that the UK is facing tight electricity supplies because of rising demand and capacity constraints.  They warned of a greater risk of blackouts and “significant price spikes” in the coming months.  Mr Kwarteng, responding to the report, said that “we are absolutely confident in the security of our supply”. He added: “It shows that as far as energy security is concerned the UK is an excellent place.” He also pointed to decarbonisation as a means of protecting consumers from volatile fossil fuel prices.  Ahead of the Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow, he said: “The UK so far, as many of you know, has made great progress in diversifying our energy mix. But we are still very dependent, perhaps too dependent, on fossil fuels and their volatile prices.” He said the government’s pledge to decarbonise the electricity grid by 2035 would help consumers.

       "  'content': 'Steel, ceramics and chemicals factories could be forced to temporarily close within weeks due to rocketing electricity and gas prices, the government will be warned today. Industry leaders in these energy intensive sectors will meet the business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng on Friday afternoon. They plan to lay out the severe impact energy prices for electricity and natural gas have had on their operations, the Independent understands.  The group of energy intensive industry bodies are set to lay out how even the largest companies with strong balance sheets are facing punitive costs to hedge their energy prices in the months ahead. It is no longer a matter of a handful of a few vulnerable businesses, two industry insiders told the Independent, many large firms are also under huge pressure in the face of sharp price hikes.  The impact of sustained high energy costs is so severe several companies are weighing temporarily closing operations in the weeks and months ahead. Electricity hedging costs for early next year are five times the average seen last year in some cases.  Meanwhile, with a major interconnector with France still out of action, many industry groups believe there is an elevated risk of a sharp spike in next-day electricity costs. Even companies which buy contracts to guard against energy hikes well head of time cannot avoid next-day prices entirely. This practice known as ‘hedging’ also cannot guard against a long-term hike in energy costs.  Amid higher costs for raw materials, labour shortages in key logistics industries and elevated shipping charges many UK manufacturers are facing an “all round crunch”, according to one leader who is set to attend the meeting on Friday.  In the immediate aftermath of the energy price spike triggered by the fire in September which hit the interconnector, prices hit record highs and some factories closed temproraily rather than pay the exorbitant cost. The energy link is not expected to be fully operational until March next year, according to the National Grid’s winter outlook for electricity, adding to the risk of blackouts.  Mr Kwarteng, who is due speak with business leaders over video call this afternoon, is not expected to offer a quick solution to the problem, according to industry sources. A government source close to the talks said that the business department has been “monitoring the impact of higher energy prices on companies on a daily basis” and was keen to “gather more intelligence” from business groups today.  They added that the government had already taken a range of steps to try and mitigate the impact of higher prices on manufacturing and other sectors. This has included cutting the fees for gas transmission for companies.  However, energy intensive industries will try and make the case for the UK to create similar levels of support seen in other EU countries such as Italy and France, which they argue are more generous.  The Portuguese government has slashed network charges for companies, in Italy, renewable levies on energy bills have been cut and France has taken the relatively drastic step of offering a guaranteed price for wholesale energy for industry. Gareth Stace of UK Steel told BBC Radio 4s World at One: “The prime minister this week is calling for a high wage economy. The steel sector already does exactly that - we pay our workers 45 per cent higher wages in regions where steel is, they’re highly skilled as well. “If you’re paying as much for gas and electricity as we are as a steel sector, then these unprecedented price rises are hurting us now today. “If the prime minister and government does nothing to help us, they could start to strangle steel production here in the UK and rather than working towards a high wage economy, we’ll actually be walking blindly towards a low wage economy.” Mr Stace said: “At the moment, there’s an energy crisis. If government does nothing, tomorrow there’ll be a steel crisis “In terms of what impact that could have on jobs, that wouldn’t be good not only for the steel sector and for those regions where there is steel but for the UK economy as a whole.” In the immediate aftermath of the energy price spike triggered by the fire in September which hit the interconnector, prices hit record highs and some factories closed temporarily rather than pay the exorbitant cost. The energy link is not expected to be fully operational until March next year, according to the National Grid’s winter outlook for electricity, adding to the risk of blackouts. However, any closures are extremely expensive for some industries, and can do damage to equipment and production processes that cost tens of millions of pounds. The cost of recovery may be too great for some. Mr Kwarteng, who is due speak with business leaders over video call this afternoon, is not expected to offer a quick solution to the problem, according to industry sources.  A government source close to the talks said that the business department has been “monitoring the impact of higher energy prices on companies on a daily basis” and was keen to “gather more intelligence” from business groups today.

The Portuguese government has slashed network charges for companies, in Italy, renewable levies on energy bills have been cut and France has taken the relatively drastic step of offering a guaranteed price for wholesale energy for industry.  Mr Stace said Mr Kwarteng needs to “take immediate action ahead of the Spending Review to address the price disparity between the UK steel sector and the steel sector in Germany”.  He added: “We pay something like 50 to 80 per cent more for our electricity than our direct competitors in Germany.  “There are a number of ways that the government could today, this week, change that and put us on that level playing field with Germany.  “We’ve set those out in detail, we’ve given them the solutions to address carbon prices, renewables, capacity charges, network charges. They could do that now, and also do what other countries in Europe are doing - like Italy and Portugal - where those governments have already committed billions of euros to address the wholesale price increases.”  A business department spokesperson said: “We are determined to secure a competitive future for our energy intensive industries and in recent years have provided them with extensive support, including more than £2bn to help with the costs of energy and to protect jobs. “Our exposure to volatile global gas prices underscores the importance of our plan to end Britain’s dependency on fossil fuels and build a strong, home-grown renewables sector so we can protect consumers into the future from gas prices set by international markets.” Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies Power costs are putting even well-hedged companies under huge pressure.

       "  'content': 'As we gradually transition out of Covid restrictions, information workers are finding themselves in terra incognita. Do we go back to offices rapidly and if so how? What do we need to equip our teams not just in terms of productivity but also wellbeing and good mental health? And, as the consensus of wisdom suggests it will be, with Frost & Sullivan finding that 83% of IT decision makers expect at least one-quarter of their employees will work remotely at least sometime in 2022, \\xa0what does a hybrid approach to work look like? Those of us who have had long careers in the technology sector have tended to have more freedoms relating to how and where we work than others. When I worked in marketing and brand management in India, there was an expectation that we would work traditionally in offices, at our own desks, at prescribed hours. Later, in consulting, everyone had an assigned desk, but the fact that we were working on a global scale meant few of us were actually at them. At a software giant, my work was totally remote, and at an internet giant, I was primarily back to desk work. Where and how work happens depends on people, culture, workloads and the task at hand. However, pre-Covid, leadership teams across Fortune 500s and enterprises didn’t spend hours figuring out how and where to work as they are doing today. The convoluted question of how best to get work accomplished is now a CEO and management team issue across every sector. There are more questions than answers, and we can’t know with conviction what even the near-term future of work will look like. We must be humble in our planning, be able to absorb lessons and course-correct accordingly. It makes sense to reflect on what we have learned from this tumultuous year-and-a-half, both for what’s best for the enterprise as well as from the perspective of our careers. 2020 and 2021 encompassed domestic battles for bandwidth that forced us to prioritise who could get access to precious Wi-Fi links and when. This formula was in constant recalibration: children’s online lessons ranked first, then parents’ Zoom/Teams/Meet calls. We all became network managers, capacity planning, investing in better bundles and deeming unlimited data cellular packages worth the price. The next step might be that we all become network engineers too. It seems likely that more of us will work from home and that means moving beyond consumer-grade bandwidth packages, where speeds are measured in single megabits and security depends on how recently you patched and updated your router. Connectivity matters more than ever and it’s incumbent on companies such as Colt to come forward with partnerships and offers and suggest new best practices, because if your home is now a productivity zone then enterprise-grade networks can’t just be located in shiny urban towers. Equipping users with excellent home networking, training, support and security will become a line item on many corporate spreadsheets. And as AR and VR grow and video and voice quality continues to evolve, we’ll be more dependent than ever on a communications infrastructure that is resilient and won’t buckle under new network traffic and usage patterns, just like the metropolitan-centric ones that have long prevailed. VPNs and network tariffs that can be easily dialled up and down have a clear relevance here, and Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) is our friend, delivering protections and policy-based access to services regardless of where we are physically. Remote communications and teamwork have been turbo-charged by video, so we have to adjust our capacity planning accordingly. More than half of HR managers feel that weak technology infrastructure is the biggest impediment to successful remote working. We also need to consider the human factor. Our eyes are tired from the glare of ring lights, our vision blurred with the constant close-ups of video calls and our spines stressed as we put in 10-hour days hunched over our home office spaces. At Colt, we have introduced “clear your plate” days where we advised everyone who could to shun video call tools and be anywhere other than their home desks. And when we did, we saw productivity go up. Technology also stepped up to bring to life our need for contact, community and symbolism. Starved of human contact, tools such as WhatsApp Groups and Facebook Workspaces became emergency zones for culture, empathy, sympathy and banter. The extent to which we are tribal became very apparent to us. It is this dual aspect of technology – bane and boon – that drives home the point that connectivity matters, but people and the human spirit matter more. We need to be mindful: I was onboarded entirely via a screen and had to understand company culture that way. But now I am having to unlearn the screen when I meet my colleagues in person. We must consider that our assumptions may be wrong and that we hold hidden biases. I enjoyed working from home but when I went into the office it was refreshing to have specific times and the rigour of an office working environment frame my day. I might expect young people to enjoy that freedom, but if they share a flat with others in cramped environments and they are trying to learn about the world of work and the excitement of being in cities then they may not. We also need to be attuned to semiotics – reading the subtle interpersonal signs and non-verbal communications that we learned by cultural osmosis in the days where we saw our colleagues on a predictable and regular basis. We know that being socially distant led to suffering for many, so we need to be aware of potential anxiety and the impact of change on mental health. The newfound freedom to work in more flexible ways will be a boon to many but we have to understand that there are catches. We must be aware of the temptation to see the colleague who is more often in the office with us as the go-to person to get things done. That may require some training and learning of new habits. The optimist in me says that in this brave new world of dynamic working we will be more fulfilled and rounded people, able to give our best selves to employers. But we will need to be attentive to the nuances of what the next months and years will bring. The trinity of people, processes and technology is more important to hold in balance than ever.

       "  'content': 'Eighteen months into the coronavirus pandemic, Britain’s busiest airport remains way behind European rivals – with a leading aviation analyst questioning whether it will ever recover its previous top spot. Ralph Anker, editor of The Anker Report, said Heathrow is now back in the top 15 of European airports. But his assessment of airport traffic in August 2021 shows it finished 13th in passenger numbers, behind both Palma de Mallorca and the secondary Paris airport, Orly. In the peak summer month, Heathrow lost 71 per cent of its 2019 traffic, and handled fewer than half as many passengers as Istanbul. Another Turkish airport, Antalya, took second place in the European airports league. Almost none of the passengers were British, due to Turkey remaining on the UK’s “red list” until late September. Moscow’s Sheremetyevo was third in Europe, followed by the three main hubs in Continental Europe: Amsterdam, Paris and Frankfurt. Each handled over 50 per cent more passengers than Heathrow. Mr Anker told The Independent: “The gradual easing of travel restrictions on passengers returning to the UK has seen, what was for many years Europe’s busiest airport at Heathrow, finally break back into the top 15 of Europe’s busiest airports in August, having fallen to 17th\\xa0in June. “However, with Turkey’s newish mega-hub in Istanbul currently handling more than twice as many passengers as Heathrow, it may take quite a while before the UK’s busiest airport makes it back to the top spot, if it ever does. “At the current rate of progress Heathrow might make the top 10 in September, but it’s too early to say just yet.” Flights to and from the UK remain well below those from other major European countries, which the aviation industry blames on severe government travel restrictions. London Stansted ranked 32nd\\xa0in Europe in August, with passenger numbers down 60 per cent compared with 2019. Gatwick has fared far worse, down 79 per cent. In 2019 Gatwick was Europe’s 10th\\xa0busiest airport; by August 2021, it had fallen to 37th. The long-established premier league of UK airports has seen some significant changes. While Heathrow is unassailable in top position, the August passenger numbers revealed by the Civil Aviation Authority show two airports – Stansted and Belfast International – doing relatively well in a dismal commercial environment. Stansted has leapfrogged both Gatwick and Manchester, with the latter two slipping one place. Belfast International’s relative success appears to be down to there being no swift terrestrial alternative for journeys to and from Great Britain. Edinburgh airport has slipped to seventh place in the UK, below Birmingham. The Scottish capital has evidently been hit harder by the UK government’s effective shutdown of inbound tourism than the English Midlands. A snapshot of European aviation operations on Monday 4 October shows UK flights 41 per cent below the same day in 2019. According to the director-general of Eurocontrol, Eamonn Brennan, the next worst performer is Germany, down 36 per cent, with France and Italy both down 28 per cent. Greece actually showed a tiny increase, with 0.2 per cent more flights on 4 October compared with the same date in 2019.

       "  'content': 'Uber is being sued over its ‘racist’ facial recognition algorithm which is five times less likely to recognise darker-skin drivers, preventing them from signing on to work. The Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWUGB) is bringing the action on behalf of an anonymous driver who says they were locked out so many times that their account was terminated, claiming indirect racial discrimination. It is also calling for a boycott of Uber and is protesting outside the the London headquarters of the ride-hailing company. Drivers are asked to scan their face, at random intervals, in order to access the back-end of Uber’s system. If they are unable to gain entry, their contracts are at risk of being terminated. Alex Marshall, IWGB President and a former gig economy courier himself, told The Independent: “The gig economy in itself is racist. It exploits predominantly migrant and ethnic minority workers. The way it’s set up is to systemically exploit these people and without fair processes in place, this just means that people are forced to accept really low pay and work in these conditions.” “By legally challenging Uber then this is something that they can’t ignore and the idea is that this then blows the lid off the wider issue of unfair treatment. “If something like an algorithm isn’t working and is firing people for the colour of their skin, then what else isn’t working at Uber? Hopefully it can kick on whether it’s Uber, Deliveroo, is to target vulnerable, precarious workers, who are completely mistreated, chewed up and spat out at the click of a button.” One in five darker-skinned female faces and one in 20 darker-skinned men fail the algorithm, according to research — a significant issue in London where up to 95 per cent of drivers are Black or ethnic minority. The case, which could force Uber to scrap its facal recognition system, has been made possible by the right to protection from discrimination affirmed by a Supreme Court ruling that found Uber drivers are workers who are protected up equalities legislation. The driver strike marks the start of a campaign by Black Lives Matter UK and the IWGB to demand Uber drop its controversial facial recognition algorithm, reinstate unfairly terminated drivers and couriers and introduce the fair terminations process called for last year by more than 70 MPs.  Obinna Uzoeghelu, 37, who lives in London, started working for Uber Eats in August 2020. His account shut for three months with no reason, for some of this time he continued working without getting paid and was ultimately forced out of the sector.  Mr Uzoeghelu, whose wife was heavily pregnant at the time, said he very hard to have dialogue with Uber, sending many emails, using all the contact options, to no avail. The IWGB has also filed a claim for indirect racial discrimination on behalf of one of its members, whose account was terminated following a facial recogni It was only when the IWGB intervened that the reason for his termination was revealed to be a facial recognition failure. Ultimately, the union was able to get the termination overturned but unfortunately it was much too late, the former employee would not have been able to make ends meet if he had waited; he now works for another food delivery service. “As a family man whose wife was about to give birth, I couldn’t sleep when this happened. I kept thinking about how we’re going to survive this,” he told The Independent. “During that period, you couldn’t even go and talk to people about how you’re feeling because of Covid regulations and lockdown. I was depressed; when you have an job that you think will help you to secure income and it’s taken away unfairly, it’s very difficult. “I was shocked and even more so that Uber withheld wages that I had earned for a several months. I support the calls to boycott Uber and strike action; people should stand up and be counted.” Apsana Begum, Labour MP for Poplar and Limehouse, said: “We know that Black and minority ethnic people are overrepresented in these areas of work but especially so in these terminations, so the facial algorithm is very concerning. “I think everyone should log off their Uber apps if they’re passengers and show solidarity with drivers across London and beyond. It’s important to support strike actions such as this and, of course, this does have an impact in terms of the revenues and profits that the company makes - Uber London had profits in excess of £6million just last year.  “We’re talking about super profits year-on-year but employees who are earning poverty wages and not getting their basic rights respected as employees. I completely support the cause for strike action.” A Black Lives Matter UK spokesperson said: \"The impact of Uber’s facial recognition algorithm reflects a complete lack of care for black people and their livelihoods. The gig economy which already creates immense precarity for Black key workers is now further exacerbated by this software that prevents them from working at all, purely based on the colour of their skin. Racist practices such as these must come to an end.\" Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies AP The IWGB has also filed a claim for indirect racial discrimination on behalf of one of its members, whose account was terminated following a facial recogni PA Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

       "  'content': 'At Business Reporter, we publish a website about cyber-security, teiss.co.uk. Needless to say, hackers are constantly trying to break it. Keeping Business Reporter and teiss safe is important. We don’t want people publishing unauthorised content or hackers stealing the contact details of our subscribers. However, as for any small business, it is very hard to find the time and resources needed to keep it secure. New weaknesses of popular publishing platforms such as WordPress (which we use) are always coming to light. It’s hard to keep up, and we can never be totally sure that we have found all the potential bugs or security weaknesses. Then we came across bug bounty and realised that tracking down bugs in our systems would be less troublesome than we first thought. Bug bounty programmes offer rewards to ethical hackers who discover bugs or security weaknesses. They are often run by big software publishers such as Microsoft so they can fix these issues before they’re discovered and exploited by the bad guys. Companies often hire a team to test the security of their website or system before deployment. But what happens when new features or updates are pushed? What about the bugs or weaknesses that these teams miss? This is why it makes sense to sign up to a bug bounty programme to ensure the system gets tested by a vast range of freelance security experts, not just one team. Bug bounty programmes also ensure that the system is always being tested, not just at one point in time. This ensures bugs introduced by new features or updates get caught and fixed before they get exploited by black-hat hackers. An ethical hacker is a security expert skilled in testing the security of websites, mobile apps and IT systems to identify bugs and vulnerabilities. These professional bounty hunters employ the same techniques used by black-hat hackers, but do so legitimately with the permission of the owner. This helps identify and resolve any vulnerabilities before they are found by hackers who are rather less ethical. Many companies attempt to run their own bug bounty programmes, but finding and managing a team of freelance hackers isn’t simple. Are they ethical? Are they skilled? Will they be bothered to work for you? And are the bugs that they uncover genuine problems? This is why even huge companies like Amazon do not run their own bug bounty programmes in-house, choosing to run them through a bug bounty platform. However, these bug bounty platforms are very expensive to start with as they are geared towards such big companies. And that’s where bug bounty comes in. The bug-bounty.com service is aimed at small and medium-sized businesses such as Business Reporter, that don’t have the time, budget or resources to build and maintain their own ethical hacking teams. Their service gives companies such as ours access to a large number of experts who can probe our defences and look for vulnerabilities. We pay a small monthly fee, with no set-up costs, and the hackers are rewarded when they discover a new bug. More on how they are rewarded in a moment. Bug bounty also employs its own team of ethical hackers to review and validate the submitted bugs, and only forward valid problems to us. If the bug isn’t real, or if it has already been fixed by a software update, we don’t get notified because it isn’t going to affect us. Not at all! Giving security freelancers free rein of your systems may seem counterintuitive or even risky at first, but these skilled ethical hackers work with your permission and within pre-agreed constraints and conditions. For example, the freelance hackers will be contractually obliged not to keep any sensitive customer data that they might uncover. It’s important to keep in mind that you are not giving these ethical hackers any advantage over other internet users. All you are doing is agreeing with them that if they find a hole in your defences, they won’t exploit it, and you will reward them for telling you about it. Every organisation needs this type of service. Like many smaller companies, we use standard software provided by major companies. Most of the time, that software is going to be relatively secure if it’s set up securely. However, a lot of major data breaches are caused by oversights and misconfigurations. Working with bug bounty means that even if we haven’t set up our systems 100 per cent perfectly, we’re limiting our risk of a data breach by ensuring our systems are regularly tested by experts. As mentioned earlier it also ensures that new updates and new features are tested. Freelance ethical hackers have a variety of motives. Some simply enjoy searching for bugs, while others do it for the money. Google paid out £5 million in total to ethical hackers last year, with the largest single reward being about £100,000. That’s a lot of money – more than we can afford. But with bug bounty, it’s up to us how much compensation we offer. Too little, of course, and most security experts won’t bother to help us, but it needn’t be expensive. Many freelance ethical hackers are building a career and finding a bug that is validated as genuine adds to their CV. Instead of paying out a small monetary reward for finding a bug, some companies may prefer to pay with “points” that are displayed on a leaderboard. This method of gamification encourages competition among bounty hunters, leading to even more vulnerabilities being found. Why did we sign up for this service? Simple. We are warned about genuine vulnerabilities in our IT systems. Each bug we are notified about has been validated by professionals, so there are no false alarms to waste our time. In addition, it doesn’t cost the earth. We just pay a small monthly fee plus a little extra each time a serious bug is found.

       "  'content': 'Economists and the head of the UK’s energy regulator have thrown doubt on Boris Johnson’s assertion that inflation fears are “unfounded”.\\xa0 The prime minister played down concerns about price rises and the cost of living in a range of TV interviews on Tuesday, the day before univeral credit – a major pillar of the social benefits system – is due to be cut by £20 per week.\\xa0 His remarks came as gas prices breached £3 per\\xa0therm\\xa0in the UK for the first time, while also climbing across Europe.\\xa0Tuesday’s rise now means\\xa0prices have tripled in the last two months and broader measures of the cost of living are also rising sharply.\\xa0\\xa0 Consumer prices rose 3 per cent in the 12 months to August, while the Bank of England expects inflation to reach 4 per cent by the end of the year, potentially\\xa0outstripping\\xa0what experts at the Office for National Statistics (ONS) believe is the best guess at true pay growth of between\\xa03.2-4.4\\xa0per cent. The prime minister told Sky\\xa0News that\\xa0supply pressures and rising costs were symptomatic of the global economy “coming back to life very rapidly” after the Covid-19 pandemic. “People have been worrying\\xa0about inflation for\\xa0a very long\\xa0time, I am looking at robust economic growth,\\xa0and\\xa0by the way, those\\xa0fears have been unfounded,”\\xa0he said, adding: “Supply will meet demand.”\\xa0 However, his remarks flew in the face of analysis from economists across the political spectrum, and the head of the UK’s energy regulator, Ofgem.\\xa0 Chief among concerns shared by economists and interest rate\\xa0setter\\xa0the Bank of England is that prices are rising while economic growth shows some signs of stalling.\\xa0 Measures of wage growth\\xa0which appear to show an uptick in pay,\\xa0and\\xa0which the prime minister has repeatedly used to justify a hard line of immigration post-Brexit,\\xa0have been distorted by the pandemic, according to\\xa0independent experts\\xa0at the ONS.\\xa0 They argue that they do not show\\xa0wage growth\\xa0which is as robust\\xa0as the prime minister’s choice use of some figures\\xa0suggests. This\\xa0paints\\xa0a falsely positive picture due to the\\xa0slump in pay earlier in the pandemic\\xa0and limits on how to measure pay rolls amid furlough and sudden lockdowns. “The public policy discussion this week has lost all touch with reality,” tweeted Torsten Bell, head of think tank the Resolution Foundation. This was because while wages in a few sectors had risen, price rises were taking hold across the economic spectrum, creating a cost-of-living squeeze, he added.\\xa0 Meanwhile Ofgem’s chief executive told the\\xa0Scottish\\xa0parliament that\\xa0soaring natural gas prices\\xa0will be “pretty difficult” for customers to contend with.\\xa0The effect would last through this winter and beyond, he told MSPs. Energy bills for 15 million households were set to increase by at least £139 under the price cap introduced at the start of October, as suppliers grapple with soaring wholesale prices following the collapse of many smaller firms.\\xa0For those consumers on prepayment meters, average prices will rise by £153. Natural gas prices\\xa0have\\xa0climbed\\xa0sharply\\xa0this year,\\xa0adding to\\xa0pressure on energy suppliers who may not have hedged their entire portfolio of customers, by locking in fuel prices ahead of time\\xa0and forcing some out of business. Ofgem’s CEO, Jonathan Brearley, told Holyrood’s energy committee\\xa0that “unprecedented changes”\\xa0in the\\xa0gas\\xa0prices\\xa0“were\\xa0putting strain on the wholesale market”,\\xa0but he argued that the price cap was still offering customers good value for money. Mr\\xa0Brearley added that “a series of factors internationally” were “constraining supply”.  He said: “It looks like there is little over and above long-term contracts coming from Russia and equally there are some issues with some of the liquefied natural\\xa0gas\\xa0(LNG) terminals – all of which means supply is constrained and demand is higher than you’d expect. “In terms of duration, it is very, very hard to tell and our view is we need to be open-minded about how long it might last, and for a range of scenarios.” Meanwhile hopes among some analysts that Russia might\\xa0increase its gas supply to Europe\\xa0in order to ease the pressures on supply going into winter, at a time of depleted reserves in the UK and continental Europe, appeared misplaced. Russian leader Vladimir Putin said that the supply crunch in Europe and beyond was the result of\\xa0“unbalanced decisions” and “drastic steps” in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, according to a report by the Reuters news agency.\\xa0 “You see what is happening in Europe. There is hysteria and some confusion in the markets. Why?\\xa0Because no one is taking it seriously,”\\xa0he\\xa0said. “Some people are speculating on climate change issues, some people are underestimating some things, some are starting to cut back on investments in the extractive industries.

       "  'content': 'Travel is changing rapidly as digital technology plays an ever-larger part in the lives of consumers. People now have access to a far wider range of information, including reviews from other travellers and virtual reality tours of resorts. But change isn’t just about better information. People are becoming more demanding as ordinary tourism become commoditised. They want experiences they would not be able to have at home and service levels they are unused to. And, in an Instagram world, they want to feel exclusive and show off that exclusivity to their friends. How about chartering an underwater submersible to view marine life beneath the waves in Antarctica? Or waking up to a private sunrise yoga session at the top of the Empire State Building in New York? In today’s world of tourism, this type of exclusive experience no longer needs to be a fantasy. As the pandemic recedes and we move away from its worst effects, people are again looking to book that much-needed break. And some, with money saved from previously cancelled holidays, can afford to spend a little more to generate those memories beyond the ordinary. But in a time of amber list uncertainties, people want something very special to tempt them to travel. Most of all, people want a little luxury, and this starts with planning a holiday. Inspiration can sometimes be hard to find. Specialist holiday planners can find you places you might not know about or think are inaccessible – perhaps places where celebrities are going or that have been in the news. Once inspired, travellers want to be confident that the details of their trip have been planned: a short, private transfer; an accessible hotel room; restaurants that understand their food intolerances; the little things that will keep children happy (and quiet), which can be a simple as their favourite snacks. They also want to know that everyone in their party will have an enjoyable time. Elderly or disabled travellers will need special attention, while people with particular interests such as music or photography will want to experience the best opportunities the trip can bring. Parents may want to introduce their children to opportunities beyond the Xbox, such as making their own wildlife safari documentary. Luxury and personal service go together. Travellers want to make the most of every second of their long-awaited trip. So who wouldn’t want to be met at the plane door and whisked through immigration and security, avoiding the crowds and the airport queues? Even more important is exclusivity – the feeling that you are privileged in a way that few others are by experiencing front row tickets to New York Fashion Week, a meet and greet with the lead cast from a Broadway show or afternoon tea with royalty in India. As well as these ‘hero moments’, travellers want the basics of their holidays to be personalised and exclusive. The little details are important, such as securing premium rooms where others can’t, arranging exclusive use of a private hideaway or obtaining tables in fashionable restaurants that are booked up months ahead. Sustainability is central to the requirements of many travellers – and especially regeneration. “Leave nothing but footprints” is no longer sufficient. People increasingly want to leave an environment that has been improved in some way by their visit. Truly sustainable travel isn’t about carbon offsets. It protects animals from poachers. It provides education to the children of hotel workers. It increases the biodiversity of forests and oceans. Luxury travellers can be part of regeneration – joining a patrol protecting endangered rhinos or even helping to build a school. Travellers who are concerned about contributing to damage caused by over-tourism should look for alternative destinations that can be equally inspiring. They could swap India’s Golden Triangle for Kerala, for example. The waterways of Ljubljana in Slovenia are just as romantic as those in Venice. And the Indian Ocean coast of Mozambique offers sun, sea, sand and silence, unlike a standard package holiday where solitude is in short supply. You won’t miss out on anything by considering the alternatives. As the world slowly reopens, more people have more to spend on holidays. Cheap and frequent city breaks are making way for occasional luxury travel that builds real lifetime memories and experiences and gives a wow factor that can be shared with friends. Travelling in today’s more complex world doesn’t have to be difficult. With the right inspiration and detailed planning, you can have the ultimate holiday.

       "  'content': 'Accepting online payments is a complex process. Brands that can reduce failed transactions will increase sales and customer satisfaction. Nothing can bring an online business to a screeching halt like a payment failure. In addition to customer irritation created from disrupted transactions, business owners risk losing customers for good. Research shows that online merchants lose 62 per cent of customers who experience a failed transaction. Whether the failure occurs during the front-end consumer experience or when the payment is being processed, shoppers will remember the negative experience and likely associate it with your brand. Why pay attention to payment failures? The damage of payment failures to your business is multi-layered. An obvious downfall is the loss of incremental – and cumulative – sales. In addition, payment failures can negatively impact the long-term reputation of your brand. And rebuilding and recovering can be an incredibly expensive and arduous process. Online stores that are able to reduce the number of failed transactions will consequently increase sales and customer satisfaction. Accepting online payments is a complex process involving a series of orchestrated steps among the cardholder, merchant, acquirer and issuing bank. One glitch in the payment system can cause a cascade of errors that eventually hamper the complete transfer or exchange of money between the two parties involved. When examining payment failures, challenges generally fall into one or more of the following areas: • Inaccurate data • Payment orchestration failures • Errors related to consumer details Let’s take a closer look at some of the risks within each area. Online payments have a strict and sensitive authentication system. Because money and personal data are involved, checkout processes are stringent when it comes to false, inaccurate or missing data. Inaccurate data can crop up at many stages of the transaction process, and it can be propagated by many stakeholders in the chain of the transaction. Any transaction with mismatched credentials or incomplete information is likely to backfire. Experienced payment providers can manage these complexities and collect the right information on each type of transaction. Payment orchestration is the handling of everything required for a payment throughout its lifecycle with all of the steps and providers involved. Payment orchestration involves many details that vary by region, bank, processor, types of transactions (such as one-time purchases or recurring purchases) and more. All these moving parts, along with advancing technology and e-commerce trends, come with possible risks that can threaten successful payment processing. When it comes to payment failures, consumers and businesses often assume the payment gateway is at fault. However, transactions can be declined for a number of reasons that involve the consumer. Some of the most common are expired cards, insufficient funds, incorrectly entered information or not enough available credit. Once you determine why payments are failing, you can prepare to reduce the number of failed transactions and consequently increase sales and customer satisfaction. Mitigate payment failures by assessing challenges and implementing solutions within two major categories: front-end consumer experiences and back-end payment processing. A better front-end consumer experience on your website can greatly reduce payment failures and the risks associated with them. Important elements of a positive front-end experience include an easily navigable website, clear customer service options, and an intuitive and localised checkout experience. While it may sound simple, you can never overcommunicate the steps you need customers to take to reduce cart abandonment and ensure a successful transaction. This customer-centric approach, paired with thorough back-end payment processing systems, can reduce failed payments. Keeping up with technology changes, industry regulations, localisation nuances and other payment processing complexities is crucial in reducing payment failures. Technologies such as machine learning and intelligent transaction routing can increase the likelihood of payments being accepted and minimise the declinment of legitimate transactions. The right payments partner can navigate these challenges and implement the optimal solutions on behalf of your brand so you can focus on your core competencies. It’s important to find a partner with proven payment orchestration expertise and the ability to route payments through an extensive network of processors. They should use new technologies and integrations to reduce payment failures for your business. One of the most effective and efficient ways to reduce payment failures is to leave the back-office payments complexities to a partner, such as Digital River. Get help navigating the ins and outs of the ever-changing global payment processing landscape from a partner with dedicated resources and established expertise in this area. Want to dive in further?

       "  'content': 'The CEO of online fashion retailer ASOS is stepping down after more than six years, following a profit warning as the firm feels the effects of the supply chain crisis. In a statement released on Monday, ASOS said it had already begun the process of finding a replacement for Nick Beighton, who joined the company some 12 years ago. Mat Dunn, chief financial officer, will take on Mr Beighton\\'s responsibilities until a successor is appointed. The change came despite ASOS announcing on Monday that adjusted profits jumped 36 per cent in the financial year ending 31 August, to £193.6m. But the online fashion giant, popular with twentysomethings for its trendy and moderately priced clothes, faces a difficult year ahead with sales growth expected to slump.  Adjusted earnings in the current financial year are estimated to plummet by between £110m and £140m.  ASOS, like many other businesses from supermarkets to petrol stations, is being hit by the ongoing supply chain crisis. The firm said “notable cost headwinds” such as rising freight costs bringing goods into the UK, Brexit duty, labour cost inflation, and outbound delivery costs are also to blame for the gloomy forecast. In addition to rising costs, the firm said it is also struggling to meet consumer demand as economies bounce back from Covid lockdowns. Following the announcement, shares in ASOS were down by as much as 16 per cent in London but began to rebound as Monday morning progressed. In other board announcements, ASOS said Ian Dyson will become chairman, replacing Adam Crozier, who announced in August his decision to step down. Mr Dyson will lead the search for the company\\'s new CEO. Meanwhile, Jorgen Lindemann, chair of Miinto, a Danish-based online fashion retailer, joins the ASOS board as a non-executive director. Mr Dyson said: \"ASOS is a great business with a strong brand and a talented team, and I am proud to be taking over as chair.  \"My key priorities will be recruiting a new CEO to take the business forward, at the same time working with Mat Dunn and the rest of the executive team to deliver our compelling strategic plan. \"I am pleased to welcome Jorgen Lindemann to the team; he brings deep experience of international digitally led businesses, which will complement the existing board expertise.\" Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies The online fashion retailer is popular with those in their 20s  PA Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Ofgem has stressed that customers will continue to receive gas and electricity as normal. The energy industry regulator said it would choose the suppliers to take over the customers’ accounts, and that the newly-appointed companies would get in contact with the account holders. Ofgem promised that any credit in customers’ accounts would be safe. Domestic customers will also be protected by the energy price cap when being switched to a new supplier. Customers of the three firms are advised to wait until a new supplier has been appointed and made contact before looking to switch. The three firms are the latest to cease trading in recent weeks amid an unprecedented spike in global gas prices. Their collapse came after failures by People’s Energy, Green Supplier Ltd, Utility Point, PfP Energy, MoneyPlus Energy, and Avro Energy. This means that nine small energy suppliers have gone bust since the start of this month. Ofgem’s retail director Neil Lawrence said: “Ofgem’s number one priority is to protect customers. “We know this is a worrying time for many people and news of a supplier going out of business can be unsettling.  “Our safety net will make sure your energy supplies continue.  “If you have credit on your Enstroga, Igloo Energy or Symbio Energy account, the funds you have paid in are protected and you will not lose the money that is owed to you.” Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies Ofgem stressed that customers will continue to receive gas and electricity as normal E+/Getty Creative Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

       "  'content': 'Higher natural gas prices will last well into next year and the UK is acutely vulnerable to the global surge, economists have warned.  Prices for natural gas have risen five-fold amid a “perfect storm” of cost pressures, with higher prices likely to be sustained until at least spring next year, energy analysts and economists believe. Gas stores across Europe are also below average for the past five years, and there is little sign that Russia or the US will fill the shortfall in a harsh winter, according to economists at Oxford Economics. Reserves stand at 72 per cent, well below the five-year average of 88 per cent. Production problems at North Sea gas producers had made the problem worse, “hampering restocking in time for the winter season”. Energy regulator Ofgem said that bills would rise by at least £139 for about 15 million households as it shifts the industry’s energy price cap higher. Three energy suppliers collapsed this week, following several others in recent weeks, in the face of record gas prices. The price cap limits the amount suppliers can charge consumers. Coal is unlikely to plug the gap left by a gas shortage, with coal prices up by 78 per cent, and a lag between China upping mining activity and higher exports.  China is also facing its own energy crunch, with survey data from the closely-watched Caixin purchasing managers’ index showing activity had shrunk amid restrictions on energy use in the world’s second largest economy. There have also been reports of blackouts in recent days in the northeast of the country. Other major economies such as India, which are very reliant on coal, are also facing low inventories of the fossil fuel. “There has been a near perfect storm of factors driving this extreme price evolution, and because they are structural in nature and can’t be fixed overnight,” the economists said in a briefing note, “we expect gas prices to remain elevated until spring 2022.” While the problems facing energy supplies are global, the UK stands out as being more vulnerable than other countries, the economists said.  “In the UK, the problem is even more acute,” they warned. There had been “severe underinvestment in storage capacity over the past few years”. “To make matters worse, the UK is far more dependent on natural gas for electricity generation compared to its EU neighbours,” the Oxford Economics briefing said. This dependency was for 40 per cent of energy generation, compared with 17 per cent in Germany and 7 per cent in France. The UK’s largest gas storage facility, the Centrica-owned Rough site, was closed in 2017. Net imports of gas to the UK more than doubled in the three months to June compared with the same period in 2020, and exports fell by more than three-quarters (76 per cent) during the same three-month stretch. The US lacks capacity at its terminals to ship as much liquid natural gas as demand from Asia and Europe requires, and serious weather events have also disrupted production at US sites. Russia has also faced challenges from 2020 disruptions to its gas production, suggesting it may not have sizeable capacity to boost supplies to Europe.  “One of the consequences of this price spike will likely be to emphasise the real-world costs of decarbonisation with the result of tipping the balance more in favour of expanding natural gas capacity, particularly in the realm of LNG,” the economists said. They added that countries, “particularly” the UK, will need “greater investment in natural gas storage sites”. A UK government spokesperson said last week in response to criticism of a lack of gas storage: “The UK benefits from having a diverse range of gas supply sources and we have sufficient capacity to more than meet demand.

       "  'content': 'How can sales intelligence tools and a new approach help build trust with B2B customers in a virtual setting? In B2B sales, not unlike in other business areas, the shift to virtual lasted too long and proved too successful to expect any quick rebound to pre-Covid practices. As recent surveys have found, currently only 17 per cent of buyers’ time is spent meeting with potential suppliers in person, and 57 per cent of them are happy to buy from a salesperson they’ve never met face-to-face. Although acutely aware of this new trend, sales professionals are often oblivious to the new approaches, attitudes and digital tools they need to adopt to thrive in this new medium. The traditional image of the glib salesman flogging ice to Eskimos is already a thing of the past. Today, there are more sophisticated datadriven ways of exceeding sales quotas. Being equipped with and understanding accurate, topical or real-time information ahead of reaching out to or engaging with customers now proves a much more effective way of building rapport. Corporate decision makers nowadays tend to trust sales professionals who keep their buyers’ and their organisation’s needs in mind throughout the whole customer journey and follow up the deal into the implementation and project evaluation phase. They will gravitate to salespeople who are knowledgeable about the strengths, as well as the limitations, of their offerings, and are ready to walk away from the deal and point the customer to a product of a different provider if they know that it’ll deliver a better solution to their problem. But it’s not only the client’s company and alternative solutions across the market that the salespeople of the future will need to be conversant with, but also the handful of individuals who typically make up the client’s buying committee and are responsible for the different stages of procurement decision-making. Buying committees comprise of individuals with different concerns and biases, therefore, it’s essential for the sales professional to collect relevant data about their background to offer tailor-made content or pertinent insights for them. Background searches on a prospect on professional social media platforms such as LinkedIn can also turn cold messaging. This is a popular tactic although it often fails because it skips the necessary steps needed to build buyer-first relationships. Data collected and analysed by LinkedIn, the world’s largest professional network, with over 774 million members globally, seems to bear out these new trends, with 63 per cent of UK salespeople reporting using LinkedIn as a source of sales intelligence. But the platform has undertaken not only to describe how the shift to effective virtual selling is taking place but also how to spearhead it. In order to turn “buyer first” into an established practice, the company has highlighted the gaping disconnect between buyer expectations and sellers’ presumptions about them. As a recent LinkedIn survey pointed out, while buyers regard active listening as the attribute they value most from salespeople, this quality doesn’t even rank in the top five hiring criteria among recruiters. There is a similar discrepancy in how the two sides see the buyer-first principle prevail. Almost half of the sales professionals participating claimed that they put the needs of their clients’ organisations first. However, only 12 per cent of buyers agreed that this was actually the case. Having identified these gaps, LinkedIn has developed sales solutions that enable salespeople to become the kind of informed challengers buyers value most, who can challenge their thinking and come up with ideas that they couldn’t have arrived at themselves – the type that currently only a meagre 10 per cent say they encounter in their professional lives regularly.

       "  'content': 'Digital Transformation is about real change from old to new in pursuit of value generation in a changing landscape. Large Enterprises often embark upon Digital Transformation to stay relevant in face of new and evolving challenges. These common sets of challenges range from legacy systems to legacy processes, culture and/or mindset. While the above is true for Large Enterprises, Digital Transformation has a different meaning in the context of Digital Native Businesses. Digital Natives are those businesses that have their inception in the last 10 years and use digital medium as their primary mechanism of value creation. They don’t suffer from legacy baggage. Digital Native businesses share the following common technological characteristics that shape their digital transformation needs: Digital Natives use cloud computing along with modern practices such as agile and continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD). However, like any business, these companies still need to evolve with technology. And in a world where technology changes so quickly this is difficult: IT architecture becomes slow and inconvenient, costs escalate, security vulnerabilities appear from nowhere, data volumes explode and cost more and more to store. Digitally Native Businesses are highly technical, but generally in specialist areas. They may be “born in the cloud” but many struggle to leverage the full potential of emerging tech such as Cloud, Data and AI. The following are the four key technological challenges on their continuous transformation journey: Hazel Oliver, CTO of Nimbla, has been in the digital space for more than two decades and has travelled across realms of technological transformation. In the above video, Hazel shares her IT journey from working in Traditional Corporations to Digital Natives with the Searce’s Executives. She centres around the requirement for Digital Transformation in Digital Natives. Watch the full video here The cloud technology available is changing constantly. The advent of containers and Kubernetes means that more can be done with fewer resources and at a lower cost. For digital natives, the Cloud’s ever-changing benefits are significant. Previously, cloud service providers only provided infrastructure; currently, they offer a full range of services, including infrastructure management. This relieves its clients of labour and allows them to focus on value creation rather than mundane responsibilities like keeping the lights on. Digital natives need to free themselves from the constraints of technological self-sufficiency if they are to achieve high levels of growth. Digitally native businesses need to accelerate using emerging technologies such as automation and machine learning. By partnering with third parties who have specialist skills, they will be able to make the most of the efficiencies that emerging technologies offer. The specialist third parties with in-depth knowledge of unused technological opportunities are a powerful way forward for these businesses to increase effectiveness and reduce operational risks.It takes a Digital Native to understand a Digital Native!

In the 12 months to 25 July, the pub chain sunk to a pre-tax loss of £154.7m, compared to a £34.1m loss a year ago. Sales were also down from £1.26bn to £772.6m. This is only the third year the company has recorded a loss in its 37-year history. Founder and chairman Tim Martin said he remained hopeful for the future and customers were starting to return since lockdown restrictions eased in the summer. Mr Martin criticised the government’s handling of the pub sector during the pandemic calling the use of lockdowns “a threat to civil society and democracy”. The Wetherspoons chief is now in a race to fill employment vacancies in struggling areas.  “On average, Wetherspoon has received a reasonable number of applications for vacancies, as indicated by the increase in employee numbers, but some areas of the country, especially ‘staycation’ areas in the west country and elsewhere, have found it hard to attract staff,” he said.  “During the pandemic, the pressure on pub managers and staff has been particularly acute, with a number of nationwide and regional pub closures and reopenings, often with very little warning, each of which resulted in different regulations.” Although pubs were entitled to government support under the furlough scheme, it has been one of the hardest-hit sectors during the pandemic, facing lengthy closures and rule changes.  Wetherspoons has also been impacted by the ongoing HGV drivers shortage leading to supply chain issues. Mr Martin did not comment on the shortages or any impact it is having on Wetherspoons, nor did the high-profile Brexit supporter try to play down links between the HGV shortages with the UK leaving the EU. He instead questioned the use of lockdown restrictions by the government: “The biggest threat to the pub industry, and also, inter alia, to restaurants, theatres, cinemas, airlines and travel companies, relates to the precedent set by the government for the use of lockdowns and draconian restrictions, imposed under emergency powers.” Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies Wetherspoons falls to a record loss PA Archive Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

       "  'content': 'Telling a work colleague to ‘grow up’ is not ageist, a tribunal has ruled in a case brought by a teenage trainee. Jasmine Stunell, a hairdressing apprentice, sued her former boss for age discrimination after the comment was allegedly made by a colleague when she was just 16. An employment tribunal heard the young stylist was also told to ‘pull herself together’. Ms Stunell later brought claims for age discrimination and constructive unfair dismissal against the salon after she quit. But the panel dismissed them after it found the remarks could be said to anyone — especially older people. It said: “The tribunal does not find the words ‘grow up’ and ‘pull yourself together’ in themselves are related to age and can be said to anyone and particularly to someone older who is acting in a childish way.” Ms Stunell had started working as a stylist at the Leo Bancroft Salon in Weybridge, Surrey, where she studied towards a vocational qualification on Saturdays in January 2017 before becoming an apprentice seven months later. At the end of her three-three-month month probationary period, owner and manager Leo Bancroft raised some issues with Ms Stunell’s performance. The panel heard she would hide during the day, be late, use her mobile phone and had a poor general attitude, including towards clients. But her performance improved and she was officially made an apprentice in February 2018 at the salon where there is said to be a ‘very good retention record’ with 70 per cent of the stylists having been fully trained by Mr Bancroft. Ms Stunell then alleged that a colleague, Amy Frith, told her to ‘grow up’ and to pull herself together through a toilet door while she was being sick, the panel heard. But the tribunal accepted Ms Frith’s version of events, in which she denied making the remark and has a phobia of vomiting so would not have been close by. In addition, Ms Stunell claimed that, in an online group chat used by the salon, a colleague had said she should be replaced with someone more reliable. The tribunal found this was also not age-related and would have been said about any member of staff who was late or disappeared without explanation during the day. The panel was told Ms Stunell walked out of work on a number of occasions due to personal matters but Mr Bancroft was “very supportive” as he knew she had a difficult home life. After she walked out and resigned, he texted her to say she had “huge potential” and a “bright future ahead,” the panel heard. The tribunal ruled Ms Stunell had not been bullied or discriminated against at work. Ms Stunell also claimed she was not allowed to take breaks but there was no evidence of this and dismissed all her claims. The panel, headed by Employment Judge Anne Martin, concluded: “In all the circumstances, the tribunal finds that Ms Stunell’s claims are not well-founded and are dismissed.” Solent News and Photo agency Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies The words were said to a young employee  Unknown Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

       "  'content': 'Army troops in combat fatigues began delivering fuel to petrol stations on Monday as drivers waited in line, sometimes for hours, to top up their tanks. Until recently, it would have been a scene that all but the most pessimistic of forecasters would have dismissed as overly apocalyptic. Yet risks to fuel supplies were both foreseeable and foreseen. Four years ago, the government identified an increased risk four years ago but neglected to update its contingency plans. Now, having failed to plan ahead, ministers are fighting a rearguard action, hoping that the presence of troops will calm people’s nerves and prevent panic buying.  An alternative interpretation is that nothing quite screams “crisis” like seeing the army on the streets. What exactly has the government done and will it be enough to solve the problems? Around 200 army personnel have begun getting fuel hard-hit areas. Half of them are tanker drivers, the rest will be supporting fuel deliveries. They have only recently undergone a short training course by logistics firm Hoyers. Tanker operators believe the new recruits will be less efficient than experienced drivers who have left the profession. Haulage industry bosses are reluctant to be seen as critical of the military but many remain sceptical that the plan will be enough. The industry is short of tanker drivers. Some have retired, others left the country and some are thought to have been lured away by the prospect of big bonuses from supermarkets. What about gaps on supermarket shelves? While fuel shortages look set to ease in the coming days as drivers fill up their tanks and demand settles down, issues in food supply chains are likely to last much longer. Problems with food are being driven by a lack of staff, not by shoppers buying more than normal. The haulage industry reckons it is short of 100,000 drivers but the true scale of the problem is not known. That estimate is based on a 2016 survey which calculated the country needed another 50,000 drivers. Since then, the number of drivers in the UK has fallen by another 50,000. The lack of issues elsewhere in the world, makes a mockery of ministers’ denials that Brexit is a factor - albeit far from the only one - causing a lack of petrol at the pumps and food on some supermarket shelves. The number of lorry drivers fell almost 10 per cent between March 2020 and March 2021. There were 16,000 fewer EU Nationals working as HGV drivers in March 2021 - a drop of more than a third in just 12 months. Some wish to work in the UK but can’t because if immigration controls imposed since 1 January.  Isn’t there a backlog of licence applications The Driver and Vehicle Licencing Authority (DVLA) has come under fire, particularly by supporters of Brexit, for a backlog of HGV licence applications. However, the organisation has hit back, stating that reporting on the issue has been misleading. It admits that there are 54,000 licences being processed but says that most of these are people applying to have their licence renewed. In the interim, those applicants can continue to drive lorries unless they have been told by a doctor that there is a reason they can’t drive. Therefore, it’s unclear how much of an impact speeding up licence renewals would have. Applications for new licences are being processed within 5 days and the DVLA says it’s getting through about 1,000 a day, on average. That is arguably a more important metric than the backlog of renewal applications. What solutions has the government pursued? Hauliers, retailers, and the food industry have been scathing of the government’s proposed solutions to supply chain problems. Central to those solutions is offering temporary visas to 4,700 lorry drivers until the end of February (having initially said they would end on 24 December).  Even if the whole allocation is taken up quickly it will replace less than a quarter of the drivers lost in the past year and less than a tenth of the number that’s thought to be needed. Many doubt that overseas workers will be keen to take up roles that mean relocating for a job that may only last a few weeks. Boris Johnson insists that companies must train UK drivers. But that will do nothing to prevent Christmas chaos. Places at HGV training centres are full, with waits of around 11 weeks to book a slot. A letter from government urging existing HGV licence holders who have left the profession to return has been mocked. The 1 million recipients included German licence-holders who have never driven a lorry.  The message from industry is clear: In the short term, only in influx of overseas workers can fix the problem; in the long term, better working conditions, higher pay and more investment - both public and private - are needed. It’s not just lorry drivers Shortages of labour are now stretching into most sectors of the economy, according to research published this week by accountancy firm BDO. Farmers say they will soon be forced to cull thousands of animals on farms because they need around 15,000 workers on meat production lines. Around 5,500 poultry workers are to be given temporary visas and ministers are discussing a further allocation for 1,000 butchers. According to Andrew Opie of the British Retail Consortium, the new visas “will barely scratch the surface” of the problem. “Supermarkets alone need at least 15,000 HGV drivers for their businesses to be able to operate at full capacity ahead of Christmas and avoid disruption or availability issues.” The British Meat Processors Association said it was “too late” to prevent Christmas disruption to supplies. A spokesperson said they believed a shortage of turkeys could cause a run on purchases of other meats, which in turn could cause shoppers to fear shortages of other products, sparking a new round of panic buying. Little the government has so far said or done has injected the confidence needed to ensure that domino effect does not happen.

       "  'content': 'UK households and businesses will pay almost three times as much for electricity next year compared to government forecasts made just months ago, putting huge strain on household budgets and the wider economic recovery, according to new analysis. The UK’s total spend on electricity will rise by £29bn to £47.5bn due to a massive spike in gas prices, the energy think tank Ember calculated. Ember said the figures underline how important it is to accelerate the transition from fossil fuels to renewables. Its report, shared exclusively with The Independent, used forward prices for electricity through 2022 to calculate that electricity will cost £150 per Megawatt hour, far in excess of the £58.50 previously estimated by the government. Around 80 per cent of the soaring cost will be due to the rising price of gas, which is used to generate electricity. Ember’s analysis also indicates that households and companies will have to endure high prices throughout next year and beyond. Markets have already priced in the fact that some causes of the soaring cost of gas, are temporary. However, even after stripping out the effects of factors such as a fire at an important interconnector between France and Britain, prices are expected to be well above the level seen before the pandemic. Phil MacDonald, chief operating officer of Ember, said: “Looking forward, gas markets are assuming some of those problems are solved so futures prices are a bit lower than the extraordinary prices we saw this week. However, he said gas prices would be supported in the longer term by rapid growth in energy demand in Asia. “There’s huge growth there, China has a shortage of coal, Japan will pay whatever it takes for imports of liquified natural gas.” “I think the price will be higher than the market is telling us at the moment.” Ember is calling for the government to ramp up investment in renewable power generation, particularly offshore wind, to shield the country from volatile fossil fuel markets. Mr MacDonald added: “The faster we get off gas the cheaper our bills will be. Renewable energy is already much cheaper, it’s subsidy-free and we should be building as much of it as we can. “A gas phase-out insulates the UK from the ongoing risk of unexpected price shocks in the global fossil fuel market.” Boris Johnson told the Conservative Party conference this week that the UK would increase its offshore wind capacity from 40 Gigawatts to 60GW. Mr MacDonald said the current gas crisis was further evidence that the government must move more quickly and in a wider range of locations. “At the moment offshore wind farms are very concentrated in the North Sea. If we broaden that out around the country then generation will be much less intermittent than it is now. If the wind is not blowing in one place it is in another place.” “That solves much of the problem of intermittent supply. Then we can look at battery storage technology “Companies are chomping at the bit ready to build it, the government just needs to give them the go-ahead.” The call came as industry leaders warned the government that they would soon be forced into further temporary shutdowns due to record-high gas prices. Bosses from energy-intensive sectors including steel, ceramics and chemicals met with Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary on Friday to call for more support. Trade body UK Steel has said UK firms are unfairly disadvantaged by the higher prices they pay for energy compared to French and German rivals. EU governments are also seen as more generous in their support for business. The Portuguese government has slashed network charges for companies, in Italy, renewable levies on energy bills have been cut and France has taken the relatively drastic step of offering a guaranteed price for wholesale energy for industry. UK consumers are facing a raft of price hikes, tax increases and benefits cuts that threaten to squeeze household budgets. Energy consultancy Cornwall Insight forecast that the energy price cap, which sets a maximum level for 15 million households’ bills, will rise by almost £400 to £1,660 in April, on top of a 12 per cent rise implemented this month. The government pressed ahead with a cut to universal credit this week that will take £1,040 per year out of the incomes of millions of low-income families. National Insurance Contributions are also due to rise next April and income tax bands have been frozen, meaning an effective tax rise for workers.

       "  'content': 'Cheap EU pork imports are flooding the UK market and undercutting British farmers just as the industry faces an unprecedented labour crisis, a leading supplier has said.  A chronic shortage of butchers has caused a massive backlog of pigs on farms, and now low prices for British produce have left some farmers facing imminent bankruptcy. Business failings are inevitable over the next few weeks unless drastic is taken, industry experts have warned, with some pig producers losing an estimated £20,000 a week.  The news comes as hundreds of pigs are slaughtered on British farms because of a lack of workers to process them for sale.  Phil Woodall, general manager at Thames Valley Cambac, a leading pig marketer, said first and foremost the sector has been hit by “a vast shortage of butchery staff as a result of Brexit, aggravated by the pandemic.” He added that the situation has been aggravated by cheap imported product coming from the EU. German producers have been limited in their ability to export pork to China, a crucial market, because of bouts of African Swine Fever.  “So Germany, one of the power houses of pork production in the EU, is flooding parts of the rest of Europe with cheap pork,” Mr Woodall explained. “This is an aggravation to the crisis, which is adding to the UK’s staff issues.” A normal animal that goes to slaughter weighs around 85kg and the cost of producing it is around 160p a kilo.  “We are being undercut by European prices,” Mr Woodall said. “Some processors have been buying those pigs - which cost 160p a kilo to produce - at 75p and 80p a kilo.  “That means some producers are losing around £68 per pig, and an average producer may sell 200-300 pigs a week.” With these prices, farmers could be losing £20,000 a week, a figure that Mr Woodall branded “unsustainable”.  He predicted inevitable business failings and, ultimately, a greater reliance on imports as British firms go bust.  “We are effectively exporting our industries to countries that have worse animal welfare standards, and the Government are standing by and watching this happen,” Mr Woodall concluded.  Meryl Ward, who runs a family farm in Lincolnshire, said that “retailer shelf is now being filled by foreign-imported pork that doesn’t meet our welfare standards.” Speaking at a Conservative conference event on Monday, environment secretary George Eustice conceded that to get the backlog of surplus pork out of the door, farmers might have to slash their prices in the short term. He said: “We might need to adjust prices to clear the backlog. Farmers won’t appreciate that with businesses at risk now.” Around 120,000 pigs await a cull if labour shortages at abattoirs aren’t remedied. On Monday, the National Pig Association confirmed that some farmers in East Anglia have already begun to slaughter more than 500 pigs to ease overcrowding.  Zoe Davies, chief executive of the group, told The Times that this was “just the beginning”. She said: “This is not excess supply, farmers have been contracted to grow these pigs, but the facilities are taking a quarter less than they agree because they simply don’t have the butchers.” Prime minister Boris Johnson has described the pig cull as part of a necessary post-Brexit transition. Speaking on the BBC One’s Andrew Marr show, he said: “I hate to break it to you, Andrew, but I’m afraid our food processing industry does involve killing a lot of animals, that is the reality.”  He added: “There will be a period of adjustment, but that is, I think, what we need to see in this country.” Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies Some British pig producers could lose £20,000 a week as prices are slashed  Getty Images Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

       "  'content': 'Rail industry figures have expressed fury after the transport secretary appeared to signal that HS2’s eastern leg could be scrapped. The current £100bn high-speed rail project follows the plans set out by the last Labour transport secretary, Lord Adonis, in 2009. It proposes a Y-shaped link from London to Birmingham with a western branch to Crewe and Manchester and an eastern branch to Nottingham, Sheffield and Leeds. Work on the London-Birmingham section is already well under way, and the administrative groundwork is being carried out for the northwest England leg. The eastern section, due to be completed by 2040, would provide connections beyond Leeds to the existing East Coast main line to York, Newcastle and Edinburgh.  But in an interview with the Financial Times, Grant Shapps appeared to suggest the eastern leg – also known as HS2 phase 2b – may never be built. He said: “We want to make sure we get trains to Leeds in a way that actually benefits people on the network and not blindly follow some plan invented 15 to 20 years ago which no longer benefits people.” Mr Shapps said: “Midlands Rail Hub and Northern Powerhouse Rail are things, they’ve been invented, they hadn’t been when HS2 was first designed. “We need to work these things together. Are we doing things in the best way and in the right order?” One alternative which is being suggested would be to extend trains from London via a new trans-Pennine high-speed line, dubbed HS3, via Manchester to Leeds. It would offer no benefit to travellers between London, Nottingham and Sheffield. Nor would it significantly cut the current Birmingham-Leeds journey time of almost two hours. The HS2 target time is 46 minutes\\xa0for the 116-mile journey between the two cities. Senior rail figures have watched the government’s ebbing support for the eastern leg of the project with growing concern. Nigel Harris, editor of Rail magazine, said: “Be in no doubt: scrapping HS2 Phase 2b will be catastrophic for transport and decarbonisation.” Gareth Davies, a railway engineer and writer, tweeted: “The eastern leg of HS2 is the most important section of the new line. “Without it, HS2 remains a bypass for the West Coast main line, massively diminishing its benefits for the whole country.” The shadow transport secretary, Jim McMahon, said: “People in the north, Midlands and beyond know all too well about the Tories’ record of failure on transport – because it affects their everyday lives. Endlessly reannouncing years-old promises just won’t cut it.” A spokesperson for the Department for Transport (DfT) said: “The Integrated Rail Plan will soon outline exactly how major rail projects, including HS2 phase 2b and other transformational projects such as Northern Powerhouse Rail, will work together to deliver the reliable train services that passengers across the north and Midlands need and deserve.”  Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies All stations?

       "  'content': 'Thousands of UK firms will not survive the winter unless the government urgently expands a support package aimed at tackling soaring energy prices, ministers have been warned. The Treasury is currently considering a bid from the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, for financial aid to help large firms, with particular focus on energy-intensive industries like chemicals, steel and ceramics. But smaller businesses and leaders from other sectors say they too need help to cope with unprecedented spike in gas and electricity prices. The situation facing small and medium-sized firms in particular is \"becoming dire\", thanks to supply chain disruption, labour shortages, price rises, soaring energy bills and taxes, said James Martin, director of policy at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC). \"If help from government is not forthcoming, then it is unfortunately the case that thousands of firms would not survive the winter as a result.\" The BCC\\'s latest survey found that more than two thirds of firms have yet to report any increase in investment or cashflow since Covid restrictions eased in the summer, with smaller firms disproportionately impacted.  While households are protected by the energy price cap, there is no limit to the amount suppliers can charge to business customers, meaning they are more exposed to the current spike. There is now a \"clear case\" for a cap for small firms, Mr Martin said. Mike Cherry, of the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said, SMEs were now in a \"very dangerous space\" thanks to a swathe of rising costs. \"Small businesses lack the leverage to negotiate with energy suppliers that bigger businesses have, and they lack the protections that domestic consumers benefit from,\" he said. The FSB is also calling for an extension of the price cap, as well as a limit on the amount of credit that suppliers can build up from each customer, as well as protection of credit balances when suppliers go bust - measures that are already in place for consumers. Car industry trade body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) stopped short of calling for direct financial aid but chief executive Mike Hawes warned that the energy crisis was putting the competitiveness of British manufacturers at risk. \"With UK electricity prices nearly double those in the EU, and gas prices rising, that puts our automakers at a very clear disadvantage,\" he said. \"For manufacturers, energy is typically the second largest in-house cost. Decarbonisation and the shift away from fossil fuels will also see a significant increase in electricity use.  \"We therefore need certainty that the UK can provide secure and sustainable low cost, low carbon energy, to maintain our industrial competitiveness and encourage drivers to make the switch to electric.” The UK has been more exposed than other European countries to rising gas prices because it is more dependent on the fuel and has less capacity to store it after a large storage facility closed down in 2017. Farmers have said that UK food supplies will be impacted from early next year because they are being forced to cut back on production due to a labour shortage and surging costs.  The construction industry is also struggling to deal with inflationary pressure. Brian Berry, chief executive of the Federation of Master Builders, said small construction firms are already struggling to “build back better” from the pandemic due to labour shortages and ongoing material price rises.  “Anything that inflates the cost of products like cement, steel or glass further, won’t help building projects. What we need is a long-term, sustainable strategy for energy, covering storage, use of renewables, and how we can retrofit our buildings to get to net zero. I hope the Government will publish such plans ahead of COP.” The Treasury is currently assessing a plan to provide loans to hard-hit businesses including steel-makers and chemicals manufacturers. But details of the proposals have not yet been provided to industry leaders who attended talks with ministers this week. Richard Leese, leader of the Energy Intensive Users\\' Group (EIUG), which has been involved in discussions, said he had been told only that \"all options were on the table\". Richard Warren, head of policy for trade body UK Steel, said state support would be welcome but industry needed to know the details. \"Loans would be a very short-term fix but we need a mechanism for securing the industry in the long term,\" he said. “We have not seen the details of what the Secretary of State has put forward. We need to see those details but the loan scheme that has been reported won\\'t fix the underlying issue. \"It might solve a problem for businesses that have an immediate cash flow issue. It allows them to pay their electricity bill. \"But that is not the problem; the problem is exorbitant energy costs.

       "  'content': 'Real-time access to information and collaboration capabilities could transform the entire construction industry. All of our lives are touched by the construction industry every day – from our homes, to our schools, to our hospitals. The industry has built the world we know, and it’s building the infrastructure we need to support a rapidly growing population. The construction sector has invested in technologies to support this growth for some time now, such as robotics, 3D printing and artificial intelligence. Yet construction hasn’t experienced the same productivity gains from technology as other sectors. Why? I’ve worked in the construction industry for most of my life, and one thing has never changed: the success of every project comes down to how well everyone on the team communicates and collaborates. Most of the available technology focuses on a few pieces of the problem, without solving the key challenge: connecting all people, systems, and data to provide a single source of truth. The need for effective connection and efficiency has grown exponentially. Today, the industry faces increasing regulatory and contractual complexity, supply chain disruptions and a dispersed, mobile workforce – all of which demand greater communication. These challenges are exacerbated by an ongoing skilled labour shortage. This puts even more pressure on an industry that is already low-margin and high-risk. No matter the headwinds this industry faces, it will find a way to build. There will always be a need for new infrastructure, homes and hospitals to be built. Growth begins with connecting everything and everyone in one place. Take HBS Group Southern, a large UK-based building services specialist. It has unlocked real-time insight into project performance across more than 50 projects, each of which has between 50 and 600 different plots over multiple phases and involves over 150 subcontractors, electricians, plumbers and apprentices across different locations. Think about the costs saved by being able to accurately forecast material requirements across these jobs, amid a volatile market. Similarly, consider what it means for Swissroc to be able to use a single, centralised platform to streamline workflows and standardise processes. Swissroc regularly saves weeks in administrative work and produces higher quality builds, which has led to increased referral business and a 300 per cent increase in revenue three years in a row. For small and large companies alike to realise these efficiency gains and scale to meet global demand, teams must be empowered with actionable data, and equipped with technology that puts their data to work. According to McKinsey, assembling and analysing data is one of the most critical ways to unlock greater productivity. The opportunities with this data are virtually limitless, but I’m excited about a few areas in particular: 1. Preconstruction Eliminating information silos in the preconstruction phase is essential for accuracy and visibility into project performance. Every stakeholder must have access to the same information. This enables, for example, the estimating team to efficiently develop and win competitive bids or price changes that occur, while the project team won’t be adversely impacted by outdated information or information lost during the handoff from the preconstruction team. 2. Collaborative and efficient design Innovation in building information modeling (BIM) has allowed construction professionals to track, manage and collaborate on all 2D and 3D designs, thus eliminating confusion and rework in the field. For example, Josh Soules, a foreman at North Mechanical Contracting, said: “Having access to elevation drawings, on the fly, in Procore, is just one more tool that enables me to do my job more efficiently.” 3. Ongoing cost management Cost management is top of mind for all construction companies as they grapple with demand and changes brought on by the pandemic. Building a bridge between incurred and reconciled costs is a responsibility shared by all, and connectivity is key as different parts of a business unite to maximise profits. Success requires all stakeholders to be united on one platform for transparency, collaboration and control. Efficiency as a result of connectivity in construction is an immediate, global issue. When communication is seamless and decisions are based on accurate information, productivity soars. This will transform the construction industry so it can better scale for an ever-growing global population and an insatiable demand for infrastructure.

       "  'content': 'Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said he is proud of the £70bn furlough programme which helped workers across the UK throughout the Covid pandemic. The scheme ends on the last day of September after supporting some 11.6 m workers over the past 18 months. However, the government faces calls to provide further financial help for the thousands of people who have relied on the scheme until this point, including those who have not managed to reenter the workplace. Sunak insisted everyone has now returned to work, and there will be support beyond the furlough scheme focused on giving people the skills and opportunities for employment. Speaking on a visit to a factory in North Yorkshire, the chancellor said: “I’m so proud of what [furlough] has achieved. It has protected millions of people’s livelihoods at a difficult time. “But I’m also really proud of everyone who has shown such resilience over the last year-and-a-half through this. Everyone is now back at work, and that’s a fantastic thing.” As the furlough scheme comes to an end, uncertainty remains for almost one million workers who were expected to still be receiving its support at the end of September, according to data from the Office for National Statistics. The Bank of England and other economists have warned there is likely to be a rise in unemployment due to new redundancies, and recovering industries such as hospitality and tourism. There are fears businesses that have struggled to regain pre-pandemic dynamic may lay off employees once the financial support stops. Rest Less, a platform offering advice and help for the older people, said the pandemic had had a devastating impact on over-50s, with many at risk from redundancy. Founder Stuart Lewis said: “With more than half a million people aged 50 or older still on furlough at the last count, we may well see hundreds of thousands of hardworking, experienced older workers enter redundancy and, ultimately, find themselves looking for a new job in the run-up to Christmas.” Sunak argued whilst it was natural for the furlough scheme to come to an end, the government was “not done supporting people”. He added: “Our plan for jobs is literally throwing the kitchen sink at helping people get the skills they need and find new opportunities.\" “We also announced today a half-a-billion pounds programme to provide support to people, to help them get through the winter. We appreciate that the prices of some things have gone up rapidly. \"And the half-a-billion pounds will help three or four million of our most vulnerable families with £100 or £150 over the winter period.

       "  'content': \"More than 130 countries have agreed to a global deal aimed at deterring large multinational companies from moving their profits to tax havens. The deal includes a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15 per cent and rules to force large companies with high profit margins to pay more in the countries where they earn money. The OECD, which hosted the talks, said the minimum rate could raise $150bn (£110bn) worldwide. The deal was agreed by 136 countries, including Ireland, Hungary and Estonia, which have low corporate tax rates and had been resisting. But the deal faces several hurdles before it can take effect. The US is debating related tax legislation proposed by Joe Biden that some in Congress fear could make American rates uncompetitive. A rejection by Congress would cast uncertainty over the entire project.  Signatory countries agreed to a two-year ban on imposing new taxes on tech giants while the deal goes to Congress. The US had threatened sanctions against countries including the UK and France over digital services taxes designed to raise more money from tech giants. The minimum corporate tax rate would come in from 2023. The other part of the deal would allow countries to tax a portion of the profits earned in their jurisdiction by large companies regardless of whether they have a physical presence there.  This provision would affect around 100 global firms. The OECD said more than $125bn (£92bn) in profits would be reallocated under the provision. Nigeria, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Kenya have not signed the agreement. Anti-poverty and tax fairness advocates have said developing countries stand to benefit less from the deal than wealthy countries.  The G24 group of developing countries said that without a bigger share of revenue from reallocated profits, the deal would be “sub-optimal” and “not sustainable even in the short-run”. But the OECD said developing countries stand to make greater revenue gains from reallocation than richer countries. The deal is expected to be finalised by G20 finance ministers next week, and then by G20 leaders at a summit in Rome at the end of October. Negotiations over the deal have been ongoing for years. Countries have grown more concerned with offshore tax avoidance over the past decade or so and a global consensus was seen as the most effective way of tackling the practice. Leaders and finance ministers have welcomed the deal. Mr Biden, who strongly backed the proposal, said: “For decades, American workers and taxpayers have paid the price for a tax system that has rewarded multinational corporations for shipping jobs and profits overseas.  “This race to the bottom hasn't just harmed American workers, it's put many of our allies at a competitive disadvantage as well.” UK chancellor Rishi Sunak said: “We now have a clear path to a fairer tax system, where large global players pay their fair share wherever they do business.” Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said countries owed it to their citizens to ensure tax was paid more fairly: “I look forward to the G20 Summit at the end of the month, where we will finalise the details of this agreement.” Tech giant Facebook also welcome the deal. Nick Clegg, vice president of global affairs, said: “Facebook has long called for reform of the global tax rules, and we recognise this could mean paying more tax, and in different places.” Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies The move was welcomed by Facebook, although some large developing countries did not sign up  Getty/iStock Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

       "  'content': 'Nestle has become the latest victim of the supply chain crisis, with the company saying it is “working hard” to ensure Quality Street boxes will be available this Christmas.  The maker of Lion bars and Kit Kats has been hit by the ongoing chronic HGV driver shortage, which has led to empty shelves in supermarkets and fuel shortages at forecourts.  Mark Schneider, the chief executive of Nestle, said the company is working hard to guarantee that its most popular Christmas treats would be available for Britons this winter. “Like other businesses, we are seeing some labour shortages and some transportation issues but it’s our UK team’s top priority to work constructively with retailers to supply them,” Mr Schneider told the BBC. When asked if he could guarantee that boxes of Quality Street would be in the shops this December, he said: “We are working hard.”  The announcement comes after HGV drivers told The Independent that the Christmas period will bring the worst of the shortages due to demand.  “Christmas is going to be the biggest problem because people will be bulk buying their food for family dinners and then you’ve also got the likes of Amazon and big online retailers that will be moving a lot more than they’re moving now,” said driver Jason Garland.  The boss of Tesco, Ken Murphy, said on Wednesday that shoppers are buying frozen turkeys weeks early to try to avoid any supply issues.  The supermarket giant said it was confident of good product availability for Christmas but there could still be “bumps in the road” amid supply chain challenges affecting the sector. The government’s recent visa scheme to bring 5,000 foreign lorry drivers into the UK to solve the shortage crisis was met with criticism as the scheme was set to end on Christmas Eve, sparking questions around the number of drivers who will be interested in filling vacancies. Meanwhile, Boris Johnson recently confirmed that just 127 of the 300 visas for tanker drivers to come to the UK immediately had been granted, adding: “What that shows is the global shortage.”  Mr Johnson continued: “The supply chain problem is caused very largely by the strength of the economic recovery.” Health secretary Sajid Javid told Sky News on the issue of HGV driver vacancies: “Of course there is competition for drivers – that’s taking place throughout Europe – but it is important that we try to do what we can.  “I am confident with the temporary visa changes that have been announced we will get more drivers.” Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies The makers of Quality Street have been affected by the ongoing chronic HGV driver shortage  PA Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

       "  'content': 'Energy bills are set to jump by almost one third for millions of households this spring after the price of natural gas soared to a new record level on Wednesday, with experts forecasting that worse is yet to come. Experts now forecast that the energy price cap, which sets a maximum that suppliers can charge for gas and electricity, will have to rise by a further £400 when it is next reviewed by regulator Ofgem in February, coming into effect in April. It would mean the cost of gas and electricity for the average home is around £1,660 per year. The unprecedented jump of almost a third would come on top of the recent 12 per cent price cap increase, which came into effect on 1 October, and follows warnings that 3.5 million people will be unable to heat their homes this winter. Households on fixed-rate tariffs, which are not covered by the price cap, will see their bills rise sharply when those deals come to an end and they are switched over to suppliers’ standard variable tariffs. The alarming increase in energy prices will add to fears of a devastating cost-of-living crunch that is set to hit millions of households, sparking comparisons with the 1970s Winter of Discontent and the period of post-War austerity. It came as Boris Johnson addressed the Tory Party conference, hailing his ambition to create a high-wage, high-skilled economy on the same day that millions of the poorest families saw their annual incomes slashed by £1,040 after the government pressed ahead with a £20-per-week cut to Universal Credit. Labour has argued that, as well as throwing many more households into poverty, the £6bn benefit cut will also choke the UK’s faltering economic recovery by taking money out of the hands of those most likely to spend it. Charities warned that the energy price spike will mean more people will fall into fuel poverty over the coming months. Households are being advised to stick with their current supplier because there are no cheap deals currently available, and as fixed-rate deals end, default standard variable tariffs will be the cheapest options.  The cheapest fixed-rate tariffs now available on price comparison sites are around £500 above the current energy price cap level of £1,277, which is the maximum rate firms can charge on their standard variable tariffs. Yet the latest 12 per cent rise in the price cap means households still face big increases when their current deals come to an end, with a further spike when the energy price cap is reviewed. Energy consultants Cornwall Insight predicted that the cap would rise by almost one third to £1,660 based on wholesale energy prices. Pantheon Macroeconomics predicted a similar 33 per cent increase. In the interim, more energy firms are expected to go bust because they will be unable to absorb record wholesale gas prices, which cannot be fully passed on to customers. Ultimately, any costs resulting from suppliers failing are borne by consumers through a levy which is recovered through energy bills. Industry analysts say the costs could hit more than £3bn. Credit ratings agency Moody’s sounded the alarm about UK retail energy suppliers in a report on Wednesday. Joanna Fic, senior vice president at Moody’s, said: “The cost of energy supplier failures – which could well exceed £1bn and could be a multiple of that in a scenario with a higher number of market exits – and higher energy bills will exacerbate affordability concerns and the risk of credit negative political intervention.” Customers of failed firms are advised not to switch because they will face higher prices if they do. Ofgem will switch all customers to a new company under the “supplier of last resort” process. Credit balances are protected and must be honoured by the new supplier but customers’ bills are likely to increase when they are switched over. On Wednesday, the price of natural gas for next-day delivery in the UK hit 400p per therm before falling back to 256p. Energy is one of a range of essential goods that is rising in price, with businesses across swathes of the economy saying they expect to hike prices further. Global disruption to supplies and a labour shortage – both of which have been exacerbated by the government’s handling of Brexit – mean that companies are paying significantly more for materials, parts, workers and shipping. Costs must soon be passed on to consumers, business groups say. Gas prices fell back from their peak on Wednesday afternoon after Vladimir Putin said Russia would step in to help stabilise global energy markets. The Kremlin’s past statements on gas supplies have fuelled criticism from European politicians who believe that Russia could increase output if it wanted to, but is instead choosing to restrict supply as a way of exerting its power. Russia wants the EU to green-light the opening of the completed Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which would allow more gas to be pumped from the gas fields of Siberia into Europe. Russia’s state-backed Gazprom is a key source of income for the Kremlin. The UK is more vulnerable to rising gas prices than other nations because it relies more heavily on natural gas to heat homes. The UK also has less storage capacity after the government allowed a plant which stored three-quarters of the country’s natural gas to be closed. Europe is dealing with a shortage of natural gas thanks to a cold winter which left stocks low, before a calm summer with less wind than normal, meaning it was less able to rely on renewable energy. The problem has been compounded by lower-than-expected gas supplies from Russia and higher demand for liquified natural gas in Asia.

       "  'content': 'Insurance is evolving at an extraordinary rate. Gone are the days of maintaining the status quo while speculating what the future of the industry may or may not look like. In the post-Covid market, proactive innovation and flexibility in line with constantly evolving consumer needs are paramount to success and should remain top-of-mind for industry leaders serious about change. There are three future-gazing motor insurance insights to consider. The common topic and golden thread linking these together is collaboration. Without it, the industry is doomed to stagnate. The adoption of industry-leading technology is fundamental to future success, as has been evident with the rapid rise of InsurTech over the past year. This shift should not be seen as a threat to the traditional annual motor insurance model. Instead, it should be seen as an opportunity for collaboration to drive meaningful change in line with rapidly evolving consumer demands. We know that various forms of lockdowns prompted consumers to reconsider whether annual insurance was still right for them, and they increasingly began to explore more flexible options. This overnight shift in consumer behaviour meant that the large annual insurers were encumbered by legacy systems that did not feature the flexibility or agility to respond accordingly. InsurTech companies, which provide fully digital usage-based insurance (UBI) products such as temporary car insurance, were able to swiftly adapt to market changes and meet new consumer demand instantly. Large insurers generally lack the agility to respond swiftly according to unpredictable market trends, and this is where smaller InsurTech businesses can prove to be invaluable partners, as they are at the heart of the digital UBI product revolution. They have the proprietary technology and skillset to create bespoke digital products for large insurers, thereby enabling them to keep up with the industry disruptors through collaboration rather than direct competition – all while satisfying ever-evolving customer demand at a competitive cost.\\xa0 This ultimately means that UBI products should be seen as a complementary add-on, rather than an outright replacement to the existing annual model, which still has an important role to play. Of course, it’s a two-way street, and InsurTechs can also benefit substantially from collaborating with large insurers. By partnering with a widened portfolio of well-established underwriting partners, InsurTechs are able to expand their coverage options and acceptance criteria while ensuring they offer their customers a comprehensive choice of the most competitively priced policies in the market. Greater collaboration with data enrichment service providers is another fundamental aspect of future success. As technology becomes more sophisticated, so do fraudsters. If insurers are not adequately prepared to tackle fraud with the latest real-time data available to them, they run the risk of implementing inefficient pricing models that negatively impact honest customers. There are a number of ways to overcome fraud through data enrichment, such as accurately ascertaining the link between a bad credit risk and the likelihood to claim or identifying the risk of payment fraud based on credit data. This is especially important for short-term insurers as payment could potentially be rejected after cover has expired. Another increasingly important aspect for all motor insurers is to use the most accurate data to legitimatise the validity of a customer’s ability to drive and qualify for any restrictions on driving offences. It also serves to dramatically reduce unnecessarily long and complicated question sets for the customer, thereby improving the overall user journey and customer experience. Collaboration within the insurance space is paramount to future success, but the industry should be careful not to insulate itself from new opportunities that reach further and add greater value to the end-user. For example, an existing motor policy offering can be enhanced by partnering with a recovery service provider to add breakdown cover as an option for additional peace of mind. Another option is for InsurTechs to partner with automotive retailers to offer temporary driveaway insurance policies as part of the purchase experience. This dramatically simplifies the process of how insurance is purchased and consumed as dealerships can offer customers a fixed-price insurance solution that is more transparent and user-friendly, thereby creating a more positive experience of getting a newly purchased car insured. These insights only scratch the surface of what is potentially achievable through collaboration. One thing is for certain: the opportunities are endless, and so too are the future prospects for insurance.  InsurTech should be embraced, not resisted, by established players in the insurance industry.

       "  'content': 'In a changing retail landscape, mistakes can be costly A sportswear giant uses Greek-style lettering to spell out the name of its brand, only to be widely ridiculed for using the wrong letters. A major sports and outdoors shop is fined for using incorrect warning labels on its products. An online fashion retailer mails out clothing many sizes too big, enraging shoppers and receiving mockery on social media. Occasionally, mistakes such as these are to be expected. Consumers know that not every purchasing journey will be a smooth one. But these days, the mistakes are increasing, and shoppers are losing their cool. It’s hardly surprising. Consumers in the UK, for instance, spent an\\xa0average of £3,250 each on online shopping\\xa0last year. Yet failure to manage the complexities of such an economy – and, particularly, the product information value chains that link suppliers with customers - has resulted in chaos and growing frustration for brands and disappointment in shoppers. The situation is now so bad that some have labelled it commerce anarchy. When products were sold in brick-and-mortar stores, life was comparatively easy. Items would be sent from the manufacturers to the shops, buyers would browse the displays and purchases would be made. This process was mimicked when online shopping took off: a brand would have its own online platform, and within that space, visitors would go through a straightforward digital buying journey, purchasing products from digital shelves. But the advent of multiple channels - Amazon, Instagram Shops and other aggregators and websites - with products from hundreds of different brands has changed all this. Customer experience programmes now have multiple channels. The creation of new paths between different elements of the browsing and buying process, as well as the various parties involved – not only brands and consumers but also service providers – has greatly complicated the online journey. For instance, an item you sell might feature on your own website, as well as on Pinterest Shopping and any number of retail aggregator websites. In this fractured retail landscape, it becomes much harder to check the accuracy of the product information attached to each item, track how well it’s selling and measure other key data that brands need to configure their processes and deliver good customer journeys. In short, brands are losing insight into their metrics – control of their own products and, ultimately, the customer experience. The knock-on effects of this are multiple. You waste time and money fixing myriad individual issues, and you start to become inefficient as product data is dispersed across different systems. Your margins drop, your reputation takes a hit and a once-loyal customer base fractures and starts to shift to brands who are equipped to deal with commerce anarchy and who can deliver better customer journeys. The first thing to understand is that working to solve problems at a hyper-individual level – for instance, correcting wrong product information on a particular aggregator site – is inefficient and costly. Technology such as Productsup that centralises this work – ensuring product information is consistent across multiple channels and geographies – is essential. So too is listening to customer feedback to better understand the points of friction and what is prompting them to leave your brand for others. Unless you work on the fractured relationship between yourself and your customers by managing the various paths between product and buyer, this anarchic landscape will continue to reign. Fix it, however, and you can start to reclaim the space.

       "  'content': 'Amazon faces a £140m legal claim from delivery drivers who say they have been wrongly denied their workers’ rights and thousands of pounds in pay. Law firm Leigh Day is launching a claim against the company, saying it says has incorrectly classified drivers as self-employed, denying them holiday pay and the national minimum wage. If successful, at least 3,000 drivers could be due around £10,500 each in compensation, Leigh Day said. That would mean a bill of £140m for Amazon. Leigh Day argues that drivers are entitled to these rights because of the way Amazon dictates how they work. For example, drivers are given estimated travel times between deliveries via an app which they have to meet. They are also not able to bring parcels back to the depot so must use extra fuel to redeliver at the end of the day. This, combined with charges for van rental, fuel, and insurance can leave them with “very little” earnings, Leigh Day said. Kate Robinson of Leigh Day said: “Amazon is short-changing drivers making deliveries on their behalf. This is disgraceful behaviour from a company that makes billions of pounds a year. “Drivers delivering for Amazon have to work set shifts and book time off, yet Amazon claim they are self-employed.” It is the latest legal case seeking to assert the rights of gig economy workers. Following a Supreme Court judgment earlier this year, Uber began paying compensation to thousands of drivers it had wrongly classified as independent contractors.  Cab drivers for Addison Lee are also in line for payouts after the Court of Appeal upheld a decision that they were entitled to the minimum wage from the time they logged on as ready to take passengers to the time they logged off. Leigh Day is currently representing two drivers and is looking for others to join the legal action. At least 31 drivers contacted the firm on Wednesday, a spokesperson told The Independent. Drivers told Leigh Day that they are given estimated timings between deliveries via an app, which they have to meet, and are not able to bring parcels back to the depot so must use extra fuel to redeliver at the end of the day. When combined with charges for van rental, fuel, and insurance, this can leave them with meagre earnings, the law firm said. Amazon disputed many of the claims, arguing that drivers are paid at least £120 per day and receive compensation for their fuel costs, are not contracted directly by Amazon, and have the option of whether or not to follow the suggested route on its app, which does provide estimated timings for journeys. “We’re hugely proud of the drivers who work with our partners across the country, getting our customers what they want, when they want, wherever they are,” an Amazon spokesperson said. “We are committed to ensuring these drivers are fairly compensated by the delivery companies they work with and are treated with respect, and this is reflected by the positive feedback we hear from drivers every day.” Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies The Amazon case comes after a successful bid on behalf of Uber drivers Getty Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

       "  'content': 'Energy bills could rise further in the UK next year, analysts have warned, after research showed volatile gas prices and the potential collapse of more suppliers could push the price cap up to about £1,660 come summer. The forecast is around 30 per cent higher than the record £1,277 figure set for winter 2021-22, which began at the start of October, according to research agency Cornwall Insight. It comes as the chair of energy regulator Ofgem warned of “significant” price rises and more company failures in light of soaring gas prices. Speaking at the Energy UK conference on Thursday, at what he said was an “unprecedented” time for the energy market, Jonathan Brearley said customers will face “an extremely difficult time” as rising costs “are ultimately passed through to bills”.  He also predicted more company failures, telling attendees the industry had already seen twelve companies fail and that “given the continued volatility of the market it is likely that more suppliers will exit the market”. Follow our live coverage below Good afternoon, and welcome to The Independent’s rolling energy crisis coverage. Stay tuned as we bring you the latest updates as Ofgem warns of “significant” price rises and more company failures in light of soaring gas prices.\\n Research agency Cornwall Insight has predicted further volatile gas prices and the potential collapse of even more suppliers could push the energy price cap to about £1,660 in summer. The forecast is approximately 30 per cent higher than the record £1,277 price cap set for winter 2021-22, which commenced at the start of October. Craig Lowrey, senior consultant at the firm, said: “With wholesale gas and electricity prices continuing to reach new records, successive supplier exits during September 2021 and a new level for the default tariff cap [£1,277 for a typical dual fuel direct debit customer] for winter 2021-22, the GB energy market remains on edge for fresh volatility and further consolidation.” Energy regulator Ofgem acknowledged in a statement to the BBC that it was a “worrying time for many people”: “The energy price cap covers around 15 million households and will ensure that consumers don’t pay more than is absolutely necessary this winter. “However if global gas prices remain high, then when we update the price cap unfortunately the level would increase. “Any customer worried about paying their energy bill should contact their supplier to access the range of support available.” Industry leaders have called for “urgent action” after the National Grid said in a report on Thursday that the UK faces tighter electricity supplies this winter than it did last year because of rising demand and capacity constraints.  The operator stressed it expects gas and electricity supplies will meet the country’s needs but warned of a potential massive shock to bills. In a separate report, the operator insisted there should be no disruption from gas flames going out despite the energy crunch. Energy and business minister Kwasi Kwarteng, speaking at the Energy UK conference, said the government is confident supplies will meet demand this winter. But he warned that record wholesale energy prices - which have seen nine suppliers go bust in September alone - “may well see [more] companies going out of the market”. Energy regulator Ofgem has warned of “significant” price rises and more company failures in the light of soaring gas prices. Speaking at the Energy UK conference on Thursday, chair of Ofgem Jonathan Brearley said that customers will face “an extremely difficult time” as rising costs “are ultimately passed through to bills”. He also warned that the price cap will be likely to increase, saying that “it is designed to reflect fair costs and therefore will need to adjust over time to reflect the changes in fuel prices”. Speaking at what he said was an “unprecedented” time for the energy market, Mr Brearley said that more company failures were to be expected, reports Holly Bancroft. The energy price cap will “inevitably need to reflect” rising costs, chair of Ofgem said  Let’s take a look at the bigger picture. A survey by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed nearly a third of companies have seen a higher-than-normal increase in costs, as the supply chain crisis continued to cause chaos across the economy. While firms battle against rising costs of everything from energy to staff wages, they are resorting to increasing price tags to consumers to weather the inflation pressures. The ONS survey showed that 10 per cent of businesses reported increasing the price of goods and services in early September - up from 8 per cent in mid-August and 4 per cent in late December. Figures showed that, of these, nearly a quarter - 23 per cent - were retailers across the wholesale and consumer-facing sectors and 25 per cent in the manufacturing industry. It comes amid mounting signs of rampant inflation in the UK, including energy prices rocketing, the recent fuel shortage leading to surging costs on forecourts, and prices rising more generally in the economy. In the retail sector, the likes of Next and Hotel Chocolat have recently said they are putting up prices in the face of cost pressures, with the ONS survey also showing that businesses are struggling to fill vacancies as staff shortages – adding to price woes. When asked about all this at the Conservative Party conference this week, Boris Johnson claimed there was “no alternative” to inflation and suggested shortages were a sign Britain’s economy was “waking up” from Covid and Brexit. Sky News’ Ed Conway reports the following: Stock levels at Britain’s petrol stations recovered to an average of 25 per cent on Sunday, new figures show, though “significant regional variation” remains ranging from just 16 per cent on average in the southeast of England to 35 per cent in Scotland. Average stock levels sank to a low of 15 per cent on 25 September, the day after panic buying began, the data from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) shows. The figures show how full petrol station storage tanks are at the end of each day. Tanks were typically around 33 per cent full before the crisis began. On 24 September, fuel sales were up 80 per cent compared with normal levels. Sales remained “substantially above” average until the middle of the following week when they “began to trend back to normal levels”, BEIS added. Despite the positive news, Gordon Balmer, executive director of the Petrol Retailers Association, said on Wednesday that 13 per cent of independent filling stations in London and the southeast still do not have fuel. “This is leaving some motorists continuing to feel insecure about fuel availability at their local neighbourhood filling stations,” he warned. A driver training instructor for Hoyer Petrolog UK shows Army and RAF drivers important features of fuel tankers The Kremlin said today Russia has the potential to boost natural gas supplies to Europe where surging prices have ramped up pressure on consumers. Dmitry Peskov, a Russian government spokesman, said existing gas transit routes allow for bolstering supplies before the new Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is intended to bring Russian gas to Germany begins, operating. “There is a potential,” Mr Peskov said during a conference call with journalists, which AP reported on. “It all depends on demand, contractual obligations and commercial agreements.” Europe’s soaring gas prices dropped on Thursday, a day after Vladimir Putin suggested his country could sell more gas to European spot buyers via its domestic market in addition to through existing long-term contracts. Russian deputy PM Alexander Novak said yesterday that getting Nord Stream 2 launched would quickly stabilise European energy markets, but critics were quick to say this was merely an attempt to force regulators to move quicker on certifying the pipeline. Speaking during Wednesday’s government meeting on energy issues, Mr Putin said: “I would like to underline that the situation in the European energy markets is a bright example of the inadmissibility of hasty and politically motivated moves in any sphere, particularly in energy issues that determine stability of industries and welfare and life quality of millions of people.” He also strongly rejected criticism from some European politicians who alleged that Russia‘s failure to boost supplies was fuelling price increases, saying Russia “has always been a reliable gas supplier to consumers around the world”.

       "  'content': 'It’s the most wonderful time of the year. Well, almost. After a pretty tough twelve months, we’ve reached that point in the calendar when shops begin being decked with boughs of holly, and shelves are stocked with everything from mulled wine to turkeys. Thankfully, this year promises to be a massive improvement on the cancelled Christmas of 2020 – but things are far from back to normal just yet. Without wishing to be too “Bah! Humbug”, suppliers of a host of festive essentials have warned that stocks might not be quite at the levels we’re used to. As the prime minister appoints a supply-chain tsar to advise on the looming shortages, we’ve taken a look at a few of the festive treats that may be in short supply... Turkey The bird that sits at the centre of millions of Christmas dinner tables will be a bit less ubiquitous this year. A shortage of workers forced poultry farmers to cut production by around a fifth – between 500,000 and 750,000 birds. Non-UK workers left the country after Brexit, and a government visa scheme for 5,500 poultry production-line staff has come too late, the industry says. Turkeys, it turns out, can’t be grown overnight. Pigs in blankets A lack of labour is also causing havoc for pig farmers, who have begun culling animals and incinerating them because there aren’t enough staff in abattoirs. A backlog is building and the industry warns that as many as 120,000 pigs may have to be culled. Meat processors say they need 15,000 extra workers, but the government is offering just 1,000 temporary visas for butchers. Meat industry trade bodies say it’s too late to prevent disruption to supplies. Is any Christmas dinner complete without pigs in blankets?  The likely outcome is more meat imports from elsewhere, which British farmers say are generally of inferior quality and produced to lower welfare standards. Lamb and beef There’s some more positive news on lamb and beef, should you be seeking an alternative to turkey. Britain has plentiful supplies and they are not threatened in the same way that pork is. Unlike pigs, cows and sheep are mostly reared outside and grass-fed. If there is a backlog at the abattoir, farmers can leave these animals to graze. Most pigs are kept in sheds, and they have a smaller window in which they must be killed before they are deemed not suitable for consumption. Wrapping paper A boom in online shopping and home deliveries has increased demand for packaging, including cardboard, putting pressure on supplies. The cost of shipping all sorts of goods around the world has also risen sharply, helping to further push up the price of paper pulp. We are not likely to run out of wrapping paper, but it may be more expensive. Now may be the time to raid the cupboards for rolls of paper stashed away in years past. Christmas trees Christmas wouldn’t be Christmas without the beloved evergreen fir trees that brighten up our living rooms. The price of Christmas trees is expected to rise this year  Alas, retailers are saying that higher costs for shipping, pallets and fertiliser, combined with a lack of workers, have affected supplies. Brexit red tape has also been a factor. Mark Rofe, who owns Christmastrees.co.uk, says retail prices will be between 5 per cent and 10 per cent higher this year. He added: “It’s going to be more challenging to get hold of a real Christmas tree this festive season. However, if you are able to get one, you can expect to be paying more than you would have in previous years.” Chocolates An important ingredient for any modern festive experience has been a massive oversupply of chocolate to gorge on, preferably while remaining sedentary for days. Not in 2021. Nestle, one of the world’s biggest food producers and the maker of Quality Street, says it’s not been immune from the global supply-chain problems hitting everyone else. Roses, anyone? No chocolate? Unthinkable!  Beer and fizzy soft drinks For some, the thought of a teetotal Christmas with members of their extended family may be unappealing. So the news in September of a shortage of CO2, which is used to put the fizz in beer and soft drinks, may have caused alarm. Fear not, beer and fizzy drinks will still be available, but supplies are under a bit more pressure than usual. The government has handed millions of pounds to an American fertiliser company that supplies 60 per cent of the UK’s CO2, and allowed it to fix prices. Christmas has come early for some! Toys Like the Grinch that stole Christmas, the bosses of toy companies have been lining up to warn that kids may miss out on some of their favourite gifts. Toy sales boomed during the pandemic as parents sought to entertain children who were stuck at home. Manufacturers are facing a familiar set of problems, including a lack of raw materials and expensive shipping. Barbie maker Mattel has said it’s been affected, while UK retailer The Entertainer has also warned about stock levels. PlayStation 5 Top of many lists to Santa will be the latest incarnation of Sony’s perennially popular games console, the PlayStation 5, which has been hard to find all year. Gamers have been closely watching for “drops” of the PS5 at various retailers as stock trickles through. Sony has been struggling with a global shortage of the microchips that are found in everything from cars and consoles to stairlifts and defibrillators. The few factories that produce the chips shut down last year and have struggled to keep up with surging demand this year. The pandemic has caused a shift to living more of our lives online, meaning we have bought more electronic devices. The great PS5 shortage is likely to worsen over Christmas, so follow our live updates on where to get stock. Energy Gas prices have spiked to record levels thanks to a whole host of factors all coming together at once. A cold winter depleted supplies, and a mild summer meant renewables like wind and solar generated less electricity. Higher demand for liquified natural gas in Asia has left Europe competing for a smaller supply, while Russia has limited the amount it sends through its pipelines. What does all this mean for the average household? Bills are rising fast. The energy price cap went up 12 per cent to £1,277 from the start of October, and experts predict it could rise by a further £400 in April. Cheap deals have disappeared, so heating homes is going to be pricier this winter. Petrol Petrol station forecourts have run dry over the past few weeks and many remain empty, particularly in the southeast of England. A lack of tanker drivers initially caused shortages at some locations and prompted a round of panic-buying. While fuel supplies are gradually returning to normal, a significant number of petrol stations in the southeast remain dry  Supplies are expected to get back to normal in the coming days, but further problems at the pumps can’t be ruled out if people again decide to stock up for the Christmas period. Hospital beds Hospitals have been even more stretched than usual this year, dealing with a summer crisis that bodes ill for the winter months. A number of trusts have declared “black alerts” due to a shortage of beds, increasing numbers of Covid patients, and rising numbers of people turning up to A&E. A lack of intensive care beds has meant routine surgeries, including for some cancer patients, have been cancelled across England. All of which puts a lack of PlayStations, Quality Street and turkey into perspective.

       "  'content': 'The boss of a shipping agency has warned of less choice on the shelves at Christmas and urged people to plan ahead if they want to get the presents they want.  Peter Wilson, group managing director at Cory Brothers, a shipping agency that handles cargo and the logistics of processing goods, said that consumers will have to order Christmas presents far in advance to ensure they arrive as UK’s ports get congested due to the HGV driver shortage.  Shipping companies have started directing vessels away from the country’s biggest port at Felixstowe after it ran out of storage capacity.  The congestion is down to a lack of HGV drivers available to move the unloaded containers to free up space. Mr Wilson told Radio 4’s Today programme on Wednesday morning that congestion in ports was a global issue affecting Europe and the US West Coast. But added that the UK was being hit worst by the problems because of “the significant pinch point around HGV drivers”.  He continued: “That’s a really significant issue for us here in the UK. It’s much less of an issue for other European countries.” Mr Wilson said that the consumers should “be sensible, think ahead, plan appropriately, order your Christmas goods and the items that you need in a timely fashion to ensure that you have them”.  Although he said the supply chain would not completely fail, Mr Wilson said that “there is potential nearer to Christmas [for] some items maybe not being available on shelves”. He added that a range of products are likely to be affected but named white goods and Christmas toys as being particular “pinch points”.  Echoing the warnings from the world’s biggest shipping container company, Maersk, Mr Wilson said: “These issues around disruption will continue well into next year. It’s been an issues for us for about five-six months already.  “The supply chain is under considerable strain but it will not fail. Goods will be on the shelves for Christmas, there just may not be this choice that we are all used to.” Most imported toys come through the port at Felixstowe because it is cheaper to ship them than to fly them. Electronics, bikes, homeware items and New Years’ fireworks are also thought to be affected.  Thomas O’Brien, managing director of toy designer Boxer Gifts, which manufacturers its products in China, said that delivering gifts will “take longer” and be “horrendously more expensive”. He added that the company would struggle to keep price increases to “anything lower than 10 per cent”.  Co-chairman of the Conservative Party Oliver Dowden insisted that the government was “getting on with the job of addressing” the problems caused by a lack of HGV drivers.  He told Sky News on Wednesday morning: “There is though clearly a challenging problem, particulary with HGV drivers, not just here, it’s across Europe. Poland, US, even China has this challenge, that’s why we’ve been taking steps to address it, whether it is, for example with training, 5,000 more places for training HGV drivers, making the process more flexible.  “We’re working through these challenges to address them.” Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies World’s largest shipping container company Maersk diverts big cargo ships away from the UK as Felixstowe port fills up due to HGV container backlog  AFP via Getty Images Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

       "  'content': 'Amazon faces a £140m legal claim from delivery drivers who say they have been wrongly denied their workers’ rights and thousands of pounds in pay. Law firm Leigh Day is launching a claim against the company, saying it says has incorrectly classified drivers as self-employed, denying them holiday pay and the national minimum wage. If successful, at least 3,000 drivers could be due around £10,500 each in compensation, Leigh Day said. That would mean a bill of £140m for Amazon. Leigh Day argues that drivers are entitled to these rights because of the way Amazon dictates how they work. For example, drivers are given estimated travel times between deliveries via an app which they have to meet. They are also not able to bring parcels back to the depot so must use extra fuel to redeliver at the end of the day. This, combined with charges for van rental, fuel, and insurance can leave them with “very little” earnings, Leigh Day said. Kate Robinson of Leigh Day said: “Amazon is short-changing drivers making deliveries on their behalf. This is disgraceful behaviour from a company that makes billions of pounds a year. “Drivers delivering for Amazon have to work set shifts and book time off, yet Amazon claim they are self-employed.” It is the latest legal case seeking to assert the rights of gig economy workers. Following a Supreme Court judgment earlier this year, Uber began paying compensation to thousands of drivers it had wrongly classified as independent contractors.  Cab drivers for Addison Lee are also in line for payouts after the Court of Appeal upheld a decision that they were entitled to the minimum wage from the time they logged on as ready to take passengers to the time they logged off. Leigh Day is currently representing two drivers and is looking for others to join the legal action. At least 31 drivers contacted the firm on Wednesday, a spokesperson told The Independent. Drivers told Leigh Day that they are given estimated timings between deliveries via an app, which they have to meet, and are not able to bring parcels back to the depot so must use extra fuel to redeliver at the end of the day. When combined with charges for van rental, fuel, and insurance, this can leave them with meagre earnings, the law firm said. Amazon disputed many of the claims, arguing that drivers are paid at least £120 per day and receive compensation for their fuel costs, are not contracted directly by Amazon, and have the option of whether or not to follow the suggested route on its app, which does provide estimated timings for journeys. “We’re hugely proud of the drivers who work with our partners across the country, getting our customers what they want, when they want, wherever they are,” an Amazon spokesperson said. “We are committed to ensuring these drivers are fairly compensated by the delivery companies they work with and are treated with respect, and this is reflected by the positive feedback we hear from drivers every day.” Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies The Amazon case comes after a successful bid on behalf of Uber drivers Getty Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

       "  'content': 'Elon Musk is currently the richest person on the planet, and he wants to make sure the world number two knows that.  The Tesla chief on Monday responded to a tweet by his rival Jeff Bezos with a silver medal emoji, as he left the Amazon founder further behind in the race to be the world’s richest person. Musk’s personal wealth inflated to $222bn after the value of the entrepreneur’s SpaceX surged, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Bezos has a net worth of $191.6bn.  The apparent jibe by Musk was in response to Bezos’ post about an article from 1999, which criticised Amazon and predicted the e-commerce giant’s fall. The article had described Bezos as “just another middleman” and said that the idea that he has “pioneered a new business paradigm is silly”. The article did not age well. Indicating this, Bezos wrote on Twitter on Sunday night: “Listen and be open, but don’t let anybody tell you who you are. Today, Amazon is one of the world’s most successful companies and has revolutionized two entirely different industries.” While many, including Netflix co-ceo Reed Hastings, responded positively to that tweet and even praised Bezos, Musk’s response garnered the most reactions. In fact, his single-emoji tweet had received more likes and retweets than the Amazon chief’s original. Musk overtook Bezos to become the world’s richest person earlier this year. On Friday, Musk added $9bn to his wealth in a single day after an agreement with investors saw SpaceX’s value rocket above $100bn. This is not the first time Musk has presented a virtual second place medal to Bezos. After surpassing the Amazon boss’ wealth, the SpaceX co-founder took a celebratory crack by telling Forbes in an email that he would like to send Bezos a giant silver medal. \"I’m sending a giant statue of the digit ‘2’ to Jeffrey B, along with a silver medal,\" Musk wrote in a short email to Forbes in September. The rivals have gone back and forth as the richest people in the world in recent months, and remain embroiled in a race to revolutionise the space industry. The two have previously got into public spats with Musk calling Bezos a “copy cat” for his venture into space with Blue Origin.

       "  'content': 'Ministers are said to be planning new levies on gas bills as part of plans to phase out conventional boilers by 2035. The government will reduce the price of electricity by removing green levies from electricity bills and add new charges to gas bills with the aim that the overall cost to households would not be driven up, according to reports. The levies will fund low-carbon heating and are expected to be announced in the long-awaited heat and buildings strategy, which is reportedly set to be published before the Cop26 climate conference next month. Energy suppliers criticised the energy price cap on Saturday, saying it will not protect households from an expected rise in costs. Soaring gas prices have seen nine domestic energy firms go out of business, forcing 1.7 million customers to find new energy providers at higher rates. Energy firms have warned that suppliers going bust will lead to households being hit with higher costs. Paul Richards, the chief executive of Together Energy, which he said was currently running at a loss, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “The price cap as a mechanism is not fit for industry, nor is it fit for customers. “When the converse situation arises and the wholesale price starts to drop sharply, the price that will be passed through to customers in April might feel like a very, very poor deal, whereas at the moment the price cap feels like a price that is too good to be true.”  Mr Richards said while the energy cap protected customers in the short-term, there was between £1bn and £3bn in costs as a result of failed suppliers that would be placed upon businesses and households.  The Independent yesterday revealed that ministers had been privately warned that millions face potential price rises of more than one-third next spring. Energy industry sources said they told the government that a 34 per cent hike in the energy price cap could be needed next April to save at-risk firms. Gas prices are already at record highs as economies around the world recover from the pandemic. On Thursday wholesale gas prices were 10 times higher than in October last year. Some analysts forecast that bills could rise by £400 or more next year if wholesale prices continue to increase. Ofgem can change the energy cap twice a year. It raised the cap by 12-13 per cent to £1,277 a year from 1 October, following raising it in April due to rising wholesale costs. The British Chambers of Commerce called on an energy price cap to be introduced for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) struggling with rising gas prices. However, David Dalton, chief executive of British Glass, told BBC News that a price cap for SMEs would help but was probably “too little too late”.  Green levies for gas bills set to be announced within weeks The government is set to push ahead with gas bill levy plans to fund low-carbon heating within the next two weeks. The new strategy, which will reportedly be published before the start of Cop26 in Glasgow next month, involves a new carbon pricing scheme that will raise the price of gas bills.  The government plans to offset the rise by cutting the price of electricity – which is significantly higher than gas – through the removal of green levies on electricity bills over the next decade. One government source told The Times that the plans were “madness” and that Downing Street was failing to appreciate “the reality of the problem we’re facing with energy prices”. The source said: “There is still a sense that we just ride it out and it’s better in a few months’ time. But it’s very clear that it’s going to get worse before it gets better.” A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, said: “We’ll set out our upcoming heat and buildings strategy shortly. No decisions have been made.” Ministers have been warned that average annual energy bills could reach £2,000 next year if wholesale prices continue to rise. The price of natural gas stands at 213 pence per therm, which is up 461 per cent compared to last year.  Companies ‘days away’ from halting production Leaders of the UK’s energy-intensive manufacturers such as steel, glass, ceramics and paper, have warned the government that unless something is done about soaring wholesale gas prices they could be forced to shut down production. Despite holding talks with business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng on Friday, industry leaders have said no immediate solutions or commitments were reached.  UK Steel boss Gareth Stace told Channel 4 News: “What we’re asking Kwasi Kwarteng today to do on wholesale prices is just to step in, to alleviate that pressure in the short-term, just like in, say, Portugal or Italy. Their governments are already investing many billions of euros, to help their industries and the UK government has yet done nothing.” “We can’t wait until Christmas and beyond. Or even a few weeks. We need action now, it needs to be swift, decisive action,” Mr Stace said.  “At the moment, there’s an energy crisis,” Mr Stace added. “If government does nothing, tomorrow there’ll be a steel crisis.” Mr Dalton of British Glass said some companies were days away from halting production. Andrew Large, director general at the Confederation of Paper Industries also said it was clear there were “serious risks” of factory stoppages because of the price of gas being too high to bear. He warned that this would create a knock-on effect through the supply chain into consumer retail.  Conservative MPs joined forces with Labour in calls for the government to provide more support in the wholesale gas crisis.  Backbenchers Andrew Bridgen, MP for North West Leicestershire, and Miriam Cates, Penistone and Stockbridge, backed the government providing short-term support for energy-intensive industries. Jo Gideon, Conservative MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central, told the BBC that “potters, brickmakers, and material scientists” also required government support.

       "  'content': 'Greggs will accelerate plans to open new bakeries across the UK despite being hit by staff and ingredient shortages in the supply chain crisis. The Newcastle bakery chain said on Tuesday morning that it had “not been immune” to the disruptions in recent weeks and warned it expects costs to rise by the end of the year.  The company told shareholders it has “seen some disruption to the availability of labour and supply of ingredients and products in recent months”. Yet, the company also said they have seen like-for-like sales increase by 3.5 per cent in the third quarter of this year, compared to pre-pandemic levels in 2019. Greggs believes this year’s performance will surpass their previous expectations, and hopes for further expansion including the opening of 100 new shops before the end of 2021. The chain, which already has around 2,100 bakeries, said: “Operational cost control has been good and the strong sales performance in the third quarter gives us confidence as we move into the autumn.” It plans to accelerate its opening programme next year, with around 150 new shops planned as it pushes towards its long-term goal of 3,000 locations across the country. It has already opened 68 stores since the start of the year.  Greggs also hopes to double its turnover to around £2.4 billion in the next five years, through the growth of its delivery services and evening trading operations. The company is one of many food chains, including Costa, McDonald’s and Nandos, that have experienced supply disruptions in recent weeks due to shortages of, according to the Road Haulage Association, 100,000 HGV drivers post-Brexit and Coronavirus-related delays. Last month, customers reported that Greggs ran out of items such as their chicken bake and chicken sandwiches in some stores. The shortage of drivers was worsened due to the pandemic and a backlog of driver tests, and post-Brexit immigration issues have also been linked to the decrease with approximately 14,000 European lorry drivers leaving the UK last year.

       "  'content': 'Shoppers should buy Christmas dinner in advance and put it in the freezer if they want to avoid disappointment, experts have said.  They also warned that Boris Johnson’s plan to bring an end to supply chain chaos had little hope of working. In response to growing pressure, the government softened its hard line on immigration last weekend, announcing plans to allow 5,500 poultry workers and 5,000 lorry drivers to enter the UK on three-month work visas that are due to expire on 24 December.  The government hopes that the army of workers brought in from overseas will “save Christmas” but food and haulage industry leaders were quick to pour cold water on the plans. “Ultimately, now I think we have just run out of time,” said James Withers, of Scotland Food & Drink. “I don’t think there is anything that can be done now to get the Christmas trade where it should be.”  “That’s despite warnings being sounded since the summer of the scale of the potential labour shortage we might face.” Mr Withers recommended that people should “plan ahead” and think early about food that could be frozen to avoid disappointment later on. The British Retail Consortium warned 5,000 lorry driver visas would not be enough to prevent Christmas disruption. One haulage industry boss said retailers should now start prioritising deliveries of essential goods over Christmas presents because there will not be enough lorry drivers to cope with demand. A retail industry insider said they believed that the government had now accepted that there would be continued disruption to supplies but ministers think it “is a price worth paying for Brexit”. Immigration lawyers told The Independent they don’t believe applications can be processed in time to ensure shelves remain stocked. Retailers warned last week that they needed workers within 10 days to ensure normal levels of stock at Christmas, while poultry companies have said turkey could be in short supply due to a lack of production line workers. And meat industry leaders have also now warned about a shortage of pigs in blankets, due to a lack of butchers.  Yet solicitors pointed out that temporary work visas typically take “at least” three weeks to process and can take around seven weeks for non-EU applicants. The Home Office hopes the scheme will be up and running in mid-October, with applications processed in 15 working days.  The first applicants are therefore not likely to be working until the second week of November, meaning drivers would be expected to relocate to the UK for just six weeks’ work before being told to leave on Christmas Eve. Immigration experts also sounded the alarm over a lack of capacity to deal with an influx of applications. The Home Office approved 19,761 temporary work visas last year. If the full 10,500 quota for Christmas workers is filled, civil servants would need to wade through an additional 50 per cent of their previous annual total in just a few weeks. No details have yet been confirmed about how the new scheme will operate, leaving employers guessing. The Independent understands that the new arrangements will be based on seasonal work visas\\xa0– known as tier 5 – typically used for agricultural workers. EU lorry drivers have said they find the prospect of just a few weeks’ work in the UK unattractive. The tight timescales for visas cast further doubt on the effectiveness of a key plank of the government response to a labour shortage that has left petrol pumps and supermarket shelves empty. Jemima Johnstone, head of corporate immigration at Gherson Solicitors, questioned whether the Home Office had the resources needed to process thousands of extra visas. Government guidance has been “vague” and some three-month visas may only arrive shortly before Christmas Eve, Ms Johnstone said. “We’re not sure whether visas are supposed to end on 24 December or whether that’s the deadline for applications. “Certainly for poultry workers this is a pre-Christmas issue so there is no point applying that late. It has got to get started soon to have any chance of delivering anything that we need.” Non-EU applicants face a further barrier because they have to attend an interview with officials in their home country, often waiting weeks to get an appointment. The Home Office plans to extend the use of an app that speeds up the process but it is not yet available for temporary workers. It is also feared that the £244 visa fee may discourage some potential applications. When added to the costs of relocating to the UK, it would represent a significant proportion of the likely pay of a poultry production line worker between now and Christmas Eve. Ms Johnstone warned of further problems if other industries push for their own temporary visa quotas. “If each industry gets its own special visa, but only when it can persuade the government that it’s hitting crisis point, then what we’re planning for is not a long-term solution for labour shortages. “It’s a series of crises – and very public ones, as whoever calls the biggest crisis gets the biggest visa allocation.” Rob Hollyman, director of Young’s Transportation, described the visa scheme as “pathetic”. He warned that it would make “very little difference” to Christmas stock levels because, at best, it can only replace a quarter of the 20,000 drivers who have left the UK and not returned.  “Somebody up the supply chain needs to make the decision that we either have luxury goods and Christmas presents, or essentials.  “We need to get essentials like washing powder, toilet roll on shelves before we have cuddly toys and jigsaw puzzles.” Increasingly desperate calls from food industry figures for action to prevent worker shortages in the wake of Brexit had been ignored by the government for at least a year, Mr Withers said. “We’re seeing gaps on supermarket shelves already. I don’t think those gaps are going to improve. They could get worse.” Fears of supplies running low were not “in any way allayed” by the government’s announcement on temporary visas, he added. “We need an immigration policy that is smart, it’s not about rhetoric and it’s certainly not about being hostile to the very people we need to attract to this country.” A government spokesperson said: “This is a global problem and we have been working closely with industry for months to understand how we can boost recruitment. “However we also want to see long-term solutions delivered by employers through improved testing and hiring, with better pay and working.” Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies Getty Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the UK’s ongoing fuel crisis. Military personnel have started delivering fuel to petrol stations for the first time in a bid to tackle the ongoing supply crisis. About 200 military personnel, half of them tanker drivers, have hit the road under Operation Escalin, to deliver fuel to forecourts across the country. Namita Singh reports: About 200 military personnel have hit the road under Operation Escalin to deliver fuel to forecourts across the country Rishi Sunak has spoken about the fuel crisis this morning, saying the situation was “improving”.  “These are the facts, so no one is trying to sugarcoat it,” he told LBC. “We know there’s enough petrol at our refineries and our terminals, and the issue is we’ve had a very steep demand spike.” He added: “The good news is it is getting better, so I think every single day since about last Tuesday we’ve delivered more petrol to forecourts than has been taken out, the number of people getting deliveries has increased, the volume of fuel getting delivered has increased.” The chancellor said the situation “has been improving” for over a week.

       "  'content': 'The UK is aiming to deepen trade ties with the Gulf in a move that will mark one of its most controversial negotiation efforts to date.  Trade secretary, Anne-Marie Trevelyan will hold talks with Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) secretary general Dr Nayef Falah M Al-Hajraf and members of the Bahrain government, which currently holds the rotating presidency of the GCC, on Friday. The move comes as the trade department calls for views on how it should approach talks asking for views from businesses and civil society. It is hoping to negotiate with a block of Gulf states, rather than pursuing bilateral deals. The consultation process will last for 12 weeks and formal talks are slated to start in 2022. The GCC comprises Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates. Each state has been the subject of significant human rights concerns, from treatment of migrant workers to the murder of Saudi journalist, Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey in 2018.  The UK has a significant arms trade with GCC members, and accounts for around one in five of Saudi Arabia’s arms imports, some of which have been used in the conflict in Yemen, according to data gathered by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. This new deal, however, will largely aim to deepen ties in areas such as the life sciences, healthcare and green energy, according to people familiar with its planning. Oil rich members of the GCC are seeking to diversify both their energy usage but also their wider economies, away from a dependency on oil.  The step comes as Britain grapples with its post-Brexit strategy for attracting foreign investment. The UK has long sought to attract GCC wealth to its shores, and even changed the rules on how companies are listed on UK stock exchanges in a move widely seen as a bid to woo the listing of oil giant, Saudi Aramco in 2018. The Saudi Public Investment Fund, a sovereign wealth fund overseen by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, is understood to be providing 80 per cent of an imminent £300m takeover of Newcastle football club. Sacha Deshmukh, Amnesty International UK’s chief executive has described the deal as an effort to “sportswash” the country’s “appalling human rights record”. Separately, human rights campaigners accused Boris Johnson of “fueling repression” by meeting with Bahrain’s crown prince earlier this year, after a UN high commissioner said the country’s treatment of prisoners violated international law. People familiar with the British Diplomatic Service have often claimed that its deep ties to GCC members, built on a complex colonial history in the region, have proved critical in sensitive intelligence relations, including with the United States. “A trade agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council is a huge opportunity to liberalise trade with a growing market for British business and deepen ties with a region that is vital to our strategic interests,” the trade secretary said. Amid mounting economic pressure on farmers, including worker shortages abattoirs and seasonal workers, the trade department is hopeful that a GCC deal could boost their export prospects in the Gulf. The UK exported around £600m worth of food and drink to the region last year. The trade secretary said she wanted a deal which “breaks down trade barriers” for food, drinks, digital services and renewable energies.  The GCC has a common external tariff – a tax on imports – of 5 per cent on most goods. This is relatively low compared to some other economies. This is, in part, because GCC states are import dependent in a range of areas, most particularly agricultural products, importing around 85 per cent of their food. This means there will be little impact on British good exports from lower tariffs alone. There are also trade tensions within the GCC, amid economic competition and political rows between Saudi Arabia and UAE. With the UK’s negotiations taking a grouped approach, rather than with bilateral deals, it is not yet clear how it will navigate some of these internal politics.

       "  'content': 'Fears are growing of Christmas chaos for British businesses and consumers after industry warned of factory shutdowns within weeks as fuel prices spiral upwards. In an emergency conference call with energy intensive industries, business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng was warned that electricity costs five times their normal level were “not sustainable” for a host of companies – some of which risk irreparable damage to facilities if they are forced to turn the power off. Meanwhile, in an indication of growing concern in Downing Street about shortages in the shops at Christmas, Boris Johnson appointed a supply chain tsar to try to ensure the smooth flow of goods after weeks of empty shelves in supermarkets and snarl-ups at ports. Downing Street itself acknowledged the issues facing businesses across the UK were now “acute”. Sir Keir Starmer accused the prime minister of allowing the country to descend into chaos by failing to develop a plan to cope with shortages of workers, including HGV drivers and meat processors, or with the unprecedented spike in global energy prices. And Labour branded Johnson a “chancer” after he turned to former Tesco CEO Sir David Lewis as supply chain adviser just days after accusing business of creating the labour crisis by underpaying staff and relying on cheap migrant workers. Sir David will head a new Supply Chain Advisory Group operating until the end of this year in a bid to head off shortages of goods in the vital festive period of soaring demand. As Ofgem warned of a “significant” rise in domestic heating costs in the spring, industry sources told The Independent they expected April’s hike in the energy price cap to be a massive 34 per cent, pushing bills for around 15 million households on default tariffs over £1,700. The developments came as the Bank of England warned of a wave of insolvencies from companies left vulnerable by the scale of debt they have accrued during the Covid-19 pandemic - including from government loans to keep them going through the outbreak. And research by the Office for National Statistics found that one in six adults in Britain (17 per cent) have been unable to buy essential food items and 23 per cent non-essential food items because they were not available in shops in the last fortnight. Friday’s video meeting between Mr Kwarteng and the Energy Intensive Users Group (EIUG) came after the\\xa0government rejected suggestions that they might have to curb industrial energy use with a 1970s-style three-day week this winter due to a global supply shock that economists fear could derail the recovery from the pandemic. China’s regime has instructed coal mines to increase output after the country suffered blackouts in recent weeks,\\xa0and the EU Commission is working on potential plans to pool natural gas purchases and storage. Speaking after the talks, UK Steel director general Gareth Stace called on the government\\xa0to act as soon as possible to\\xa0ease pressures\\xa0on industry\\xa0by cutting green levies on energy bills, as well as network charges. “On Wednesday, the prime minister said that the economy should move toward higher wages,” said Mr Stace. “The steel sector is a high-wage employer, providing high-skilled jobs that pay significantly more than the regional average. “Failing to act will mean we move away from a high-wage economy and walk blindly toward a low-wage one. We are a sector that should be at the heart of levelling up, bringing wealth and opportunity to communities outside London.” EIUG chair Dr Richard Leese said “prompt and preventative measures” were needed urgently to prevent recent shutdowns of fertiliser and steel plants being repeated in other sectors. Mr Kwarteng told representatives of sectors including steel, chemicals, paper, mineral products and glass that he was “keen to help our industrial base”. “We want to help as best we can,” said the business secretary. “There needs to be a cross-Whitehall effort and I can help make your case.” But there was no immediate announcement of action after what sources said was a listening exercise. Officials are to gather more data and information from companies over the coming weeks. And shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said: “This is an energy crisis made in Downing Street. Kwasi Kwarteng is scrambling to meet industry bosses but he is all talk. “This chaotic Tory government got us into this mess in the first place and has no plan to address it. Warm words at a meeting will be cold comfort for consumers and business who are facing ever increasing energy prices and a cost of living crisis.” The director-general at the Confederation of Paper Industries, Andrew Large, said it was “very, very clear” across all sectors that there are “serious risks of factory stoppages as a result of the costs of gas being too high to bear”. He warned: “In those circumstances, there will be a gradual knock-on effect through supply chains, right the way across manufacturing, consumer retail and other products. And so the risks are very, very real.” Teun Voeten Teun Voeten Teun Voeten Teun Voeten Teun Voeten Teun Voeten Teun Voeten Teun Voeten Teun Voeten Teun Voeten Teun Voeten Teun Voeten Teun Voeten Teun Voeten Teun Voeten Teun Voeten Teun Voeten Teun Voeten Teun Voeten Teun Voeten Teun Voeten Teun Voeten Teun Voeten Teun Voeten Teun Voeten Mr Stace said that producers are struggling in the\\xa0face of energy prices five times last year’s average\\xa0on top of sudden, erratic price spikes. He added that “longer and more frequent pauses in production are becoming a fact of life” for the manufacturers.\\xa0“These circumstances are simply not sustainable for the sector. We urge the government to take action, as has been done in Italy and Portugal, to support the sector.” “Energy prices are so high that some companies have been forced to suspend production even at a time when the market for steel is incredibly healthy.” While transport secretary Grant Shapps said the UK was now “at the tail end” of a petrol crisis which has seen pumps run dry for more than two weeks, the new supply chain tsar will be confronted with a host of other potential Christmas shortages, from computer consoles to pigs in blankets. On top of expensive and time-consuming Brexit red tape at the border, businesses in the supply chain have been disrupted by an estimated 100,000 shortfall of HGV drivers – many of them EU nationals who stopped working in the UK after its withdrawal from the EU. Supply chain issues have been massively exacerbated by the Covid pandemic, which has interrupted the steady flow of imports and exports around the world and driven the cost of a 40ft shipping container from China to Europe up from around $2,000 to $14,000 or more. British farmers are increasingly irate over the government decision to allow just 1,000 visas for meat-processing staff, rather than the 15,000 the industry claims it needs. Shortages of butchers and\\xa0abattoir\\xa0workers have prompted a cull of up to 120,000 pigs, while British turkeys will also be off the menu in many households due to a shortage of farmhands and processors. Mr Johnson said Sir David “brings a wealth of experience which will help us continue to protect our businesses and supply chains” by future-proofing them against “global supply issues”. But Labour business spokeswoman Seema Malhotra said: “British business deserves better than the chancer in Number 10.  “One minute the Prime Minister is bashing business and blaming them for every ill he’s created with his chaotic government, the next he’s begging a leading businessman to help him fix shortages and the Christmas supply chain crisis.”  The CBI, which has been calling for a taskforce modelled on the government’s Cobra emergencies committee, welcomed Sir David’s appointment. Director general Tony Danker said: “Establishing\\xa0a taskforce to move quickly – with both business and government around the table – will ensure government is far better\\xa0informed about the nature and scale of the challenges and\\xa0can\\xa0formulate responses at speed.” Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies Some firms risk irreparable damage to facilities if they are forced to turn the power off Reuters Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

       "  'content': 'The UK\\'s fuel crisis is \"getting worse\" in some areas, an industry boss has warned, as queues outside petrol stations caused gridlocked traffic for the second weekend in a row.  Brian Madderson, chairman of the Petrol Retailers Association, stressed the situation remained \"critical\" in London and the southeast, despite claims from government ministers that the situation has stabilised.  Large queues and closed forecourts were reported across the capital on Saturday. Aerial footage from Honeypot Lane in northwest London showed dozens of cars lining up to enter a garage on the corner of a roundabout. BBC journalist Lewis Goodall also tweeted that queues in one area of south London were \"even longer\" than the previous week and were causing \"considerable congestion\".  Mr Madderson said that while there had been an improvement in the north of England and Scotland, fuel shortages remain a \"really big problem\" in London and the southeast. He added: \"If anything, it had got worse\".  Speaking to Sky News, he revealed that a survey conducted by his organisation has found that 16 per cent of more than 1,000 sites checked on Saturday had no fuel. It marked an improvement on the 27 per cent reported to be dry on Friday, but local bottlenecks remained. \"We need a prioritisation of deliveries to filling stations – particularly the independent ones which are the neighbourhood retail sites – in London and the southeast starting immediately,\" he added.  Elsewhere, one petrol station in Chelsea, central London, was charging close to double the average price for fuel on Saturday morning shortly before selling out completely. Cloisters Gulf Petrol station in Sloane Avenue was selling fuel for £2.68 per litre – nearly twice the average price of £1.36.  Mr Madderson said rising global oil prices meant motorists should expect higher prices at the pumps when filling stations are restocked. He added: \"Expect anything from 1, 2 or even 3p a litre increases at the pump. This is not profiteering. This is genuine wholesale price increases caused by global factors.\" Military drivers will be deployed to deliver fuel to forecourts from Monday in a bid to tackle the crisis. Almost 200 military personnel, including 100 drivers, have been training at haulier sites and will start deliveries to help relieve the situation at petrol stations. Mr Maddison said the use of the military would be a \"large help\" but warned it would have a \"limited impact\" in hard-hit areas. \"This isn\\'t going to be the major panacea\", he added.  Despite industry bosses warning that the crisis remains far from over, health secretary Sajid Javid on Saturday sought to reassure Britons that the situation was \"stabilising\" in most parts of the country and the military is only being deployed as a \"precaution\".  \"I think it is right that as a precaution that the government has asked the military to help,\" he told Sky News. \"I think that is the right measure to take to make sure that people have all the confidence that they need. \"I think that will further stabilise the situation and give more confidence.\" The government on Friday announced a U-turn on its emergency visa scheme, with 5,000 foreign food haulage drivers able to extend their temporary visas beyond Christmas Eve.  Some 300 of the haulage drivers will be encouraged to come to Britain immediately and allowed to stay until the end of March, after fears that shortages could cause chaos over the festive period.  Mr Javid conceded that there would be \"competition for drivers\" with other European countries, but he was \"confident\" the scheme would attract more EU drivers. He added: “In the short-term I think it’s right to try to see we can get more drivers [from abroad]. I think that will work.” Labour has written to home secretary Priti Patel demanding clarity on when the overseas drivers will arrive and how long they will be allowed to stay.  Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds reminded Ms Patel that as long ago as 5 August, transport secretary Grant Shapps dismissed his call for changes to the immigration points system to reflect the HGV skills shortage, telling him: “I do not support using foreign labour to tackle a long-standing issue in the haulage industry.” Meanwhile, Boris Johnson did not rule out the prospect of supply disruption at Christmas. In an interview with The Times, he insisted there would be no further increase in the 5,000 visas for lorry drivers as ministers \"can\\'t simply reach for the lever marked \\'uncontrolled immigration\\'\".  Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the Daily Mail there is global disruption to supply chains in other industries but admitted that the shortages were “very real”.  \"We\\'re seeing real disruptions in supply chains in different sectors, not just here but around the world,\" he told the newspaper. \"We are determined to do what we can to try to mitigate as much of this as we can.\" Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies Vehicles queue up outside a BP petrol station in Alton, Hampshire (Andrew Matthews/PA) PA Wire Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

       "  'content': 'An ongoing global shortage of computer chips is being blamed for new car registrations in Britain falling to their lowest levels in more than 20 years. Industry trade body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said there were a total of 215,312 cars registered in September. This was a drop of 34.4 per cent on Covid-hit September 2020 and the lowest figure since 1998. \"Supply issues caused by semiconductor shortages continue to plague industry,\" SMMT said in a statement. Semiconductors are used in chips and circuit boards and can be found in everything from mobile phones to computers. They are also used in cars and are vital for running digital displays and stability control systems.  The shortage of semiconductors is being blamed on falling car production. Despite it being a difficult year for the car industry as a whole, registrations of electric vehicles have soared. There were more than 32,000 electric cars recorded on databases in one month in September - nearly as many as registered in the whole of 2019 - 37,850 electric cars. Electric car making firm Tesla\\'s Model 3 was the best selling car in September 2021, with 6,879 of the vehicles bought by UK customers. Vauxhall\\'s Corsa was in second with 5,235 and the BMW\\'s 3 Series in third with 4,788. Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said: \"This is a desperately disappointing September and further evidence of the ongoing impact of the Covid pandemic on the sector. Despite strong demand for new vehicles over the summer, three successive months have been hit by stalled supply due to reduced semiconductor availability, especially from Asia.  “Nevertheless, manufacturers are taking every measure possible to maintain deliveries and customers can expect attractive offers on a range of new vehicles.Despite these challenges, the rocketing uptake of plug-in vehicles, especially battery electric cars, demonstrates the increasing demand for these new technologies.”  He added: “However, to meet our collective decarbonisation ambitions, we need to ensure all drivers can make the switch – not just those with private driveways – requiring a massive investment in public recharging infrastructure.

       "  'content': 'The secret offshore wealth of more than 300 world leaders, politicians and influential figures in the business world has been revealed in one of the largest ever leaks of financial data.  The Pandora Papers investigation, which involved a consortium of some 600 journalists from a variety of global media outlets, is based on the leak of some 11.9 million documents from 14 financial services companies around the globe.  Some 35 world leaders and more than 100 billionaires are implicated in the leaked documents. Among those named in the files are British prime minister Tony Blair, associates of Russian president Vladimir Putin, King Abdullah of Jordan, and Czech prime minister Andrej Babis.  The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) obtained the documents, which were then passed on to media outlets including the BBC’s Panorama programme and The Guardian. The leaked documents lay bare how the global elite use offshore tax havens to store and move their money. The documents link Mr Putin to secret assets in Monaco. A woman who was reported to be in a relationship with the Russian leader became the owner of a luxury fourth-floor apartment in Monte Carlo in 2003 weeks after giving birth.  The £3.1m property was purchased by Brockville Development Ltd, a firm based in the British Virgin Islands which was eventually traced back to Svetlana Krivonogikh, who is alleged to have been Mr Putin\\'s lover. The Kremlin did not respond to requests for comment.  Meanwhile, Czech prime minister Andrej Babis was revealed to have injected £12m into several shell companies to buy a large property, known as Chateau Bigaud, in a hilltop village in Mougins, France.  Mr Babis did not disclose the shell companies and the chateau in the asset declarations he is obligated to file as a public official, according to the ICIJ. On Twitter, Mr Babis said he had done nothing “illegal or wrong\" and suggested the leaks were an attempt to \"influence the Czech election\", which takes place next week. The leaked documents also claim that the King of Jordan secretly spent more than £70m on a property empire in the UK and US. Abdullah II bin Al-Hussein is alleged to have used a network of secretly owned firms in the British Virgin Islands to purchase 15 homes since coming to power in 1999, including properties in California and London.  Lawyers for King Abdullah denied any wrongdoing and told the BBC he had used his personal wealth to purchase the properties. Elsewhere, the leaked documents reveal that Tony and Cherie Blair saved around £312,000 in tax on the purchase of a London property by acquiring an offshore company named named Romanstone International Limited, which was based in the British Virgin Islands (BVI).  The Blairs bought the £6.45m townhouse on Harcourt Street in Marylebone by establishing a British company named Harcourt Ventures to acquire the shares in Romanstone. The manner of the deal allowed the Blairs to avoid having to pay stamp duty, as the tax is not paid when the holding company of a property is acquired rather than the building directly. In a statement, the couple stressed they had purchased the property “in a normal way through reputable estate agents” and had “nothing whatever to do with the original company nor those behind it”. They said they had “never used offshore schemes either to hide transactions or avoid tax” .  Cabinet ministers in Imran Khan\\'s government in Pakistan are also named in the documents. The files reveal that a string of government officials have secretly owned an array of companies and trusts holding millions of dollars of hidden wealth.  The documents contain no suggestion that Mr Khan owns offshore companies.

Then as now, it was difficult to match workers with the right jobs openings, leading to an uptick in unemployment even amid labour shortages in sectors like mining and farming, according to Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics.  It comes as some economists have questioned whether the UK’s facing a flashback to the 1970s. A combination of fuel shortages and signs of stagflation - where prices rise as economic growth slows - have triggered parallels with 1978-1979, a period known as the ‘Winter of Discontent’. Other issues, such as energy security concerns have drawn comparison to the so-called ‘three day week’, earlier in the same decade, where coal shortages triggered power rationing. Boris Johnson has labelled the supply chain disruption and present labour shortages in the UK as part of a “period of adjustment” post-Brexit. He, and other cabinet ministers, including business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng have argued that the government must not respond by reaching for a lever “called uncontrolled immigration”. This suggests there will not be a long-term provision for foreign workers to ease driver shortages which have caused chaos at the petrol pumps or a feared incineration of 120,000 pigs due to a dearth of abattoir and butchery workers. Meanwhile, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the economic problems caused by Brexit would be worth it in the long term in his Monday Tory party conference speech:  “I was proud to back Brexit, proud to back Leave. And that’s because despite the challenges, in the long term, the agility, flexibility and freedom provided by Brexit would be more valuable in a 21st century global economy than just proximity to a market.” However, economists are more troubled by the situation, with few suggesting there will long term wins from the present supply crunch. The pandemic’s effect, combined with the shock of disintegrating some economic ties to the continent means economists believe the UK is experiencing economic challenges comparable to 1940s, with a strong comparison between ending the furlough scheme and demobbing soldiers. In the aftermath of war, millions of soldiers were relieved of duty, but the labour market could not suddenly absorb them all. This caused the unemployment rate to increase from near zero during wartime to 3 per cent by 1947.  Yet the UK did try to fix labour shortages by encouraging immigration in the post-war period. The UK sought to attract Commonwealth migrants, who had a right to British Citizenship, from the Caribbean. In many cases the government paid for people’s passage in a bid to plug gaps in sectors such as healthcare and construction. Post-war Caribbean arrivals up to the 1970s became known as the Windrush Generation, named after the ship which bought some migrants in 1948. The post-war situation “echoes” now, with labour shortages in a range of sectors, despite unemployment still sitting at above pre-pandemic levels, said Mr Shearing. There are also parallels with higher government spending, larger budget deficits, and an increase in consumers’ savings.  “During the pandemic, lockdowns prevented consumers from spending income, causing savings to accumulate. During the war, rationing performed a similar role,” said Mr Shearing. However, there have been shifts in approaches to containing price rises by central banks, exchange rates have shifted, and the labour market is more flexible, allowing workers to move from job to job more easily. It is also unclear whether the UK’s total working population has shrunk severely, as happened post-war. Still, the comparison offers both a sense of the scale of economic challenges the UK faces, but also its economy’s ability to recover and grow. Both periods saw a sharp uptick in the level of public debt, a problem that Sunak sought to address on Monday, suggesting that tax cuts would not be possible in the short term: “Our recovery comes with a cost,” he told delegates. “Our national debt is almost 100 per cent of GDP. “So we need to fix our public finances. Because strong public finances don’t happen by accident. They are a deliberate choice. They are a legacy for future generations and a safeguard against future threats.” Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies Boris Johnson has described the challenges faced by the UK economy as a “period of adjustment”.

       "  'content': 'Ministers ignored warnings about serious flaws within the UK’s fuel supply chains for years, The Independent has learnt.  The government’s own documents and statements, dating back years, lay bare a host of concerns about the vulnerability of the petrol and diesel supply chain. Officials said a draft of legislative changes to protect the supply of fuel had been drawn up as early as 2017, but had dropped down the government’s priority list in the wake of Brexit. And they warned that the lack of action meant further supply issues were still to come. Ed Miliband, Labour’s shadow business secretary, said the government’s “appalling and wilful intransigence and complacency” had led to the current situation. “Ministers must urgently address the 100,000 HGV driver shortfall, which is at the root of this chaos,” he said. “With every hour and day that goes by the public will feel increasingly outraged by the incompetent and shambolic government that has brought us to the point.” The details of the government dragging its feet came as panic buying of fuel entered its fifth day, with queues across the country. Boris Johnson appealed for calm on Tuesday night and said the situation was improving but conceded that problems could last for weeks to come. The UK has been a net importer of petroleum products since 2006, and British refineries further curbed their capacity in response to falling demand during the pandemic.  The UK’s largest refineries have also increased their reliance upon third parties in recent years to cut costs, contracting out parts of their supply chain. These factors have added to concerns about keeping track of UK fuel stocks.  Then business minister, and now trade secretary, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, told parliament in a June written ministerial statement that the government was bringing forward new legislation so it could monitor fuel supplies in the country. This was necessary because of an “increased risk of market disruption” and the sector’s reduced “capacity to react to sudden supply and demand shocks”. She said the government did not have the tools it needed to monitor fuel stocks and that companies had fallen short on managing “higher impact risks” leaving the fuel supply chain exposed to pressures from “accidents, severe weather, malicious threats, industrial action, and financial failure”.  The government first mooted these new powers in the draft Downstream Oil Resilience Bill in 2017, but failed to bring forward legislation that would empower it to monitor the fuel supply chain until June this year.  Officials familiar with fuel security told The Independent that fresh legislation had slipped down the list of the government’s priorities despite a sharp worsening of the fuel sector’s resilience in light of the pandemic, and studies of the sectors’ financial frailties in the run-up to Brexit. “In the last year, Covid-19 has impacted heavily on the sector, and industry are now looking to how they can recover sustainably. Ensuring a reliable and secure fuel supply to essential services in coming years will be critical,” said Ms Trevelyan in a separate statement to parliament on 7 June this year.  “The government can take emergency powers during a crisis – primarily through the Energy Act 1976 and the Civil Contingencies Act 2004. However, our ability to proactively protect fuel supply is limited. The bill seeks to address this deficiency, recognising that it is better to prevent than react,” she added.  The government can take emergency powers during a crisis ... However, our ability to proactively protect fuel supply is limited A business department spokesperson said it already had a number of powers to help ensure continuity of fuel supply, but that it recognised the need to “modernise them”.  “That’s why our new Downstream Oil Resilience Bill will both complement existing powers, and strengthen them further to ensure we are fully prepared and resilient to any disruptions well into the future,” the spokesperson said. Fractures in UK fuel security were flagged to government in 2012, when a major refinery, Coryton, collapsed due to financial pressures. Concerns about petrol delivery disruption and refineries’ finances were also raised in the lead-up to Brexit, one of the top priorities of the emergency planning effort codenamed Operation Yellow Hammer.  The sector has been made more fragile by the sudden drop in demand for fuel amid the Covid-19 lockdowns. This reduced call for fuel hit some petrol makers’ balance sheets leaving them vulnerable to disruption even without the current crunch in specialist lorry driver capacity.  Essar Oil, which generates around a sixth of the fuel used in British lorries and cars, was forced to defend its financial position over the weekend amid reports it was close to collapse. It said it was “in discussions” about a “short extension” with HMRC over a £223m payment for a VAT bill.  A spokesperson for the UK Petroleum Industry Association, (UKPIA), which represents refineries in the UK, said that it had shared “early feedback on the Downstream Oil Resilience Bill with BEIS, and we will further develop our understanding of the Bill as more details emerge”. They added that UKPIA will “continue to work with BEIS to consider both the effectiveness of potential new measures and if they would contribute meaningfully to the strong market mechanisms and legislation already in place”.

       "  'content': 'Soaring energy and labour costs threaten the UK’s food security, industry leaders have warned, as pressure grows on ministers to find an urgent resolution to a set of deepening crises facing British businesses and households. The National Farmers’ Union said British farms were in an “even more precarious position” than they had been in the early days of the pandemic when close to a third of the food industry was forced to close down overnight. “We have a very real risk now of exporting parts of our farming industry overseas and reducing the capacity of UK agriculture to feed the country,” said the NFU’s vice president, Tom Bradshaw. The British Meat Processors’ Association said that supermarkets faced with rising farm prices could start sourcing more food from overseas but “the UK’s food security would suffer”. The warnings came as Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary reached a deal with US fertiliser firm CF Industries to fix the price of CO2, a gas that’s crucial for UK food production. Industry insiders criticised the deal to fix prices for CO2 as “opaque”. Mr Kwarteng submitted a bid to the Treasury on Monday calling for emergency support for energy-intensive industries hit hard by a spike in gas and electricity prices. Farming is not understood to included in the package, despite the fact that it faces severe pressure on costs. The cost of producing a pint of milk has shot up 20 per cent this year as farmers battle with a surge in energy prices and rising wages due to a shortage of workers. Some tomato and cucumber growers have already shut down production because they cannot afford to heat greenhouses while potato farmers are struggling to absorb massive increases in the cost of cold storage, the NFU said. Wholesale gas prices spiked to record levels last week and remain significantly above pre-pandemic levels with analysts forecasting they will not begin to return to normal for several months. Fertiliser, another major outlay for farmers, has also shot up in price as a result of higher gas and electricity costs. The energy crisis adds to a host of problems facing British food suppliers and comes after shoppers have experienced weeks of gaps on supermarket shelves caused partly by a shortage of lorry drivers. Retailers have advised households to stock up early to avoid disappointment at Christmas. The NFU’s Tom Bradshaw said supermarkets would soon need to increase their prices and pay suppliers more or British farmers would begin to go out of business. “We have to accept these costs need to go up the supply chain if we want a farming industry for the future. “With climate change and political instability around the world there has never been a more important time to focus on self-sufficiency, but there’s a risk that farmers are not being taken seriously.” Farmers are currently locked in “very intense” negotiations with major retailers about the need for price increases, Mr Bradshaw said. “Supermarkets are trying to deliver what they think is in the best interests of the consumer in terms of low prices, but there comes a point where you have to realise that these inflationary pressures are so real and so dramatic that the costs have to go up the supply chain. “Supermarkets will be doing everything they can to try and keep a lid on prices but ultimately I think we are at a point now where we’ve got the perfect storm. Prices have to go up.” Tim Lang, professor emeritus of food policy at City University, said the problems showed how British farming had become “disastrously” dependent on high energy consumption. “The entire farming system depends on nitrogen-based fertilisers, which are very energy intensive,” he said. He added: “We need to be concerned. There is a crisis and it isn’t being dealt with. Farmers are right to be angry with the government.” Tomato grower Phil Pearson said conditions were worse than at any time since his grandfather founded the family business in 1948. \"We have already decided that we will not be planting on 10 per cent of our land next year,\" he said. \"We can\\'t afford to heat our glasshouses and we don\\'t know if we will have the labour.\" His company, APS, has already been forced to throw away produce because there have not been lorry drivers to transport it. He added: \"There will be shortages of tomatoes at Christmas. UK consumers will have an inferior product, imported from overseas that has less flavour.\" Tomatoes produced in the UK can be allowed to ripen on the vine rather than picked when they are still orange and then developing their red colour in transit, Mr Pearson said. While indoor vegetable growers are being hit hardest by the energy price spike, all sectors of the farming industry have been hit by rising costs. Pig farmers have warned they will have to cull up to 120,000 animals because there are not enough butchers. Mr Bradshaw said pig farmers were facing an “absolutely tragic” situation. “It is inexcusable. We desperately need solutions from government to avert an absolute crisis.” Meat processors said they too were being squeezed. “We can’t keep absorbing these costs through what are already tight margins,” said Anna Proffit, of the British Meat Processors’ Association. “Up to a point the dam can hold, but at some point it will burst.” “If supermarkets source more meat from overseas they might cut down on some labour costs but the UK’s food security will suffer. It would hollow out the industry and have knock-on effects for British farming.” The warnings came as ministers agreed a deal with CO2 producers to hike the price of the gas which is crucial for packaging meat and other fresh produce. Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, hailed the agreement with US firm CF Industries, which supplies 60 per cent of the UK’s CO2. The company had shut down production at its plant last month because high gas prices meant it was no longer profitable. “Today’s agreement means that critical industries can have confidence in their supplies of CO2 over the coming months without further taxpayer support,” Mr Kwarteng said. However, food industry sources described the deal as “opaque”, saying that it had been struck between CF Industries and government without input or scrutiny from the businesses that would be forced to pay the new, higher price. One source said: “They have been able to name their price but we haven’t been told anything. We don’t know what the price is yet, we haven’t been told how it’s been calculated, we don’t know CF Industries margins, what model has been used, or how the price will fluctuate.” “We assume some sort of equation has been used and we’d like to know what it is.” The British Poultry Council welcomed the announcement, adding: “We are waiting for more information from Government on the deal and look forward to working with them upon hearing further detail.” A government spokesperson said: “The UK’s high degree of food security is built on access to a diverse range of sources including robust supply chains across a range of countries, in addition to strong domestic production. “We will continue to support our farmers to produce high quality food to some of the highest standards in the world.” Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies Getty Images/iStockphoto Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

There were some 1.102 million roles open between July and September, the Office for National Statistics said on Tuesday, an increase of 318,000 from the pre-coronavirus period of January to March 2020. It was also the second month running in which the three-month average topped 1 million, as the jobs market continued its recovery. The rate of unemployment fell to 4.5 per cent between June and August, down from 4.6 per cent in the quarter to July, the ONS added. In another sign of the buoyant recruitment market, the ONS said the biggest rise in vacancies was seen in the administration and support sector – namely temporary employment agencies – with an increase of 165,000. The number of workers being hired has also rocketed, figures showed, with 207,000 added to company payrolls between August and September bringing the total to a record 29.2 million. Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said: “The jobs market has continued to recover from the effects of the coronavirus, with the number of employees on payroll in September now well exceeding pre-pandemic levels.” However, some sectors are suffering a recruitment crisis. Nearly one-third of hospitality businesses told the ONS they were finding it more difficult than normal to fill vacancies. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, warned staff shortages could slow the economic rebound. She said: “The recovery is testing the capacity of the economy to adjust to a new post-pandemic environment, a task made more difficult by the reduced availability of overseas workers. “Acute skill shortages have pushed vacancies to record levels for a second month in a row in September, as employers struggled to find skilled staff.” Matthew Percival, of the CBI, said many firms had struggled to hire enough staff in the autumn, which was reflected in the ONS data. While Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, called the figures “encouraging”, Tony Wilson of the Institute for Employment Studies warned there could be almost a million fewer people in the labour market than before the pandemic. Mr Wilson told the Financial Times: “These shortages are holding back our economic recovery and won’t fix themselves by just exhorting firms to pay more.” Additional reporting by PA Media Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies Unemployment has fallen from summer levels, says ONS AFP/Getty Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Kajem Nava, a car park manager at the station, told the Daily Mirror that fuel had run out on Friday and the company was expecting fuel to be restocked on Monday. According to the RAC Foundation, the average price of unleaded petrol on September 30 in the UK was £1.36 and £1.48 for Super Unleaded fuel. Brian Madderson, chairman of the Petrol Retailers Association said world oil prices mean motorists should expect higher prices at the pumps — even if the current shortages subside. “Expect anything from 1, 2 or even 3p a litre increases at the pump,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today. “This is not profiteering. This is genuine wholesale price increases causes by global factors.” Meanwhile, military drivers will be deployed to deliver fuel to forecourts from Monday in a bid to tackle the crisis.

       "  'content': 'UK house prices jumped in September at their fastest monthly rate since February 2007 as buyers continued to \"race for space\", according to Halifax. The bank’s data showed that the average sale price of a home rose £4,400 to a new record high of £267,587. Property values were up 1.7 per cent in the month and 7.4 per cent in the year to September. The price of detached homes was up 8.8 per cent, or £41,000, over the year. Halifax said that a stamp duty holiday which began to taper in July before ending in October was one of a number of factors that has pushed prices up. The tax cut has attracted criticism for fuelling a property boom which has made homes less affordable. Low borrowing costs and a desire for larger properties also caused average sale prices to rise, Halifax said.  The bank expects prices to be supported into next year by a continued lack of supply. Estate agents have reported a further reduction in the supply of homes coming up for sale since the stamp duty holiday began to taper. \"The \\'race for space\\' as people changed their preferences and lifestyle choices undoubtedly had a major impact,\" said Russell Galley, managing director of Halifax. \"Looking at price changes over the past year, prices for flats are up just 6.1 per cent, compared to 8.9 per cent for semi-detached properties and 8.8 per cent for detached. \"This translates into cash increases for detached properties of nearly £41,000 compared to just £6,640 for flats. \"Against a backdrop of rising pressures on the cost of living and impending increases in taxes, demand might be expected to soften in the months ahead, with some industry measures already indicating lower levels of buyer activity. \"Nevertheless, low borrowing costs and improving labour market prospects for those already in employment are likely to continue to provide support.\" Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the EY Item Club, was more cautious about the outlook for prices. “Headwinds to further house price growth are increasing,” he said. “Households’ spending power faces both a rising cost of living and the increase in personal taxation due next April. “The weaker outlook for incomes means housing affordability, on measures such as the ratio of prices to incomes, will look ever more stretched.” Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies The average UK house price jumped by around £4,400 in September, pushing it to a new high of £267,587, according to Halifax (Yui Mok/PA) PA Wire Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

       "  'content': 'The British economy posted modest growth in August, the first full month without Covid-19 restrictions and before the impact of September’s fuel crisis is laid bare.  The recovery from the pandemic has lost momentum in recent months, and statisticians now believe activity shrank slightly in July. Output has still not recovered to reach its pre-pandemic peak and it will fall short of growth predictions laid out by the Bank of England (BoE).  Activity grew 0.4 per cent in August, below some economists’ expectations and as data has been revised to show that July’s “pingdemic” pushed the economy into a slight contraction of 0.1 per cent compared to June. Meanwhile, according to Paul Dales, chief UK economist, at Capital Economics, “The recent broadening in shortages and the fuel crisis may mean that growth has come to a near-standstill since August.”  The fresh figures come as global lender of last resort, the International Monetary Fund, underlined the risk of an inflation shock in the UK and the US in its latest health check of the global economy on Tuesday. The rapid rise in prices, combined with dampened growth prospects in the months ahead, will present a conundrum for policymakers at Threadneedle Street over whether to cut its support for the economy via ultra-low interest rates and bond buying. Interest rate rises are most often used as a tool to cool inflation generated by economic growth, rather than moderate price growth driven by supply shocks such as the recent climb in natural gas prices. Pressure is mounting on rate-setters at the BoE to lay out how they will contain inflation. Investors are betting that a rate hike could come as soon as this year. “The economy picked up in August as bars, restaurants and festivals benefitted from the first full month without Covid-19 restrictions in England,” said Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the Office for National Statistics (ONS). “However, later and slightly weaker data from a number of industries now mean we estimate the economy fell a little overall in July.” The relatively sluggish growth in July and August compared to some estimates means that the economy is still 0.8 per cent below its level before the pandemic hit in February 2020, according to the ONS. Materials shortages, which have been global in nature, show signs of acting as a handbrake on growth. These global issues have been exacerbated by acute labour shortages in the UK as the result of fewer EU migrants in areas such as HGV drivers.  In construction, the 0.2 per cent fall in output marked the third such fall in four months. More recent survey data suggests that ongoing problems with sourcing materials will constrain growth well into the winter.  Domestic crises will combine with global issues to take a further toll, economists warn. “Such drags may have become more widespread and significant in September and October, with the fuel crisis preventing some people from getting to work,” Mr Dales said. The Bank of England predicted that the UK economy would grow by 2.1 per cent in the three months to September compared to the previous quarter.  However, this prospect was now probably “implausible”, said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. It would require a sharp uptick of growth of 2.2 per cent from August to September, which none of the faster, indicative survey data supports. This means the Bank of England is likely to trim its forecast for the third quarter to 1.5 per cent on 4 November, said Mr Tombs.

In recent years, marketers have become familiar with talk of the “death of the cookie,” correlated with an increase in data privacy regulations, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Along with these limits placed on the use of third-party data by new data privacy laws, new standards are being set by tech companies, with Apple and Google taking two separate directions in paving the way to protect privacy, while enabling continued brand connections with consumers. With these changes in mind, many industry players throughout the (m)adtech landscape are seeking innovative solutions that take a consumer-centric approach: businesses want to reach audiences where it matters, powered by compliant customer data, to build a strategy that drives personalisation and meaningful outcomes. According to the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) State of Data 2020 report, 57.1 per cent of respondents stated they have already increased their use of first-party data for targeting over the past 18 months. Additionally, the use of first-party and contextual data for targeting has increased as marketers look to make better use of the data-driven transformation in a privacy-compliant way. Among the varied tactics and technologies surfacing in the post-cookie world, contextual targeting is once again making headlines, and for good reason. By design, this cookieless solution is not only privacy compliant, but built around the concept of in-the-moment marketing. Contextual advertising in and of itself, however, is not new: the original method of keyword targeting was previously a favoured tactic for marketers looking to reach the right audience in “brand safe” environments. Yet, as we transition into new waters, we are seeing a resurgence in its popularity, while acknowledging that keyword-based targeting alone does not meet the needs of today’s sophisticated media buyers. The evolution of contextual targeting needs to move from being “yet another targeting tactic” to the driver of measurable outcomes. Marketers are seeking the same outcomes that they have done since the dawn of advertising: ensuring that their coveted brands will be seen at the right time, the right place, and in the right moment. Context targeting (also referred to as suitability targeting) identifies in-the-moment marketing opportunities by analysing content along with the broad spectrum of data signals available to align consumer receptivity with the brand message. In fact, some studies suggest context targeting can increase purchase intent by 63 per cent when compared with audience or channel level targeting. In a contextual paradox, this method is the exact opposite of “brand safety blocking” from the cookie-era, when it was all about negative avoidance, and has revealed one of the critical reasons why the tools of the last era are insufficient for modern marketer needs. To identify in-the-moment marketing opportunities, next-gen context-targeting solutions must include a few key elements. First and foremost, they must be capable of analysing a variety of mediums with accuracy including text, video, audio and images – this is after all a generation that consumes ever-more content, with shifting and innovative formats across a plethora of connected devices. Secondly, marketers must extend their prior investment by leveraging targeting signals from their hard-earned first-party data. First-party data has a massive role to play in the new wave of contextual and is one of the richest forms of insight a brand can extract from. And lastly, and by no means least, marketers must look to optimise outcomes by turning campaign insights into actions that continuously drive increased performance. With the death of the cookie, the acknowledgement by Facebook that walled garden attribution is changing, and Google undertaking greater consolidation inside its ecosystem, we are at a unique moment in time where we can redefine the outcome to one that makes sense, is measurable and, most importantly, actionable. Defining a digital media outcome as the closest point to the transaction which can be accurately measured and correlated back to advertising dollars is the best way to start. By defining the digital outcome as the closest point, we have built flexibility into the definition. It evolves with brands as they make investment choices in technology and partners while providing clarity to all who strive to build a better ecosystem together. The great news is that these types of outcomes can now be achieved by using real-time contextual data signals, clearly redefining what a contextual platform should be able to do for marketers in the modern era. Now is the time for marketers to take a deeper dive into the contextual landscape as they ready themselves for the inevitable identity shift to fall into place. What won’t change in the cookieless world is marketers’ need for differentiation. It won’t change the fact that publishers need funding from advertising to survive. And, perhaps most importantly, consumers will still want personalised advertising and content experiences, tailored to them, their needs and preferences, while feeling protected against data fraud. Contextual targeting and the advancements wrapped around innovative solutions today stands strong as a solution for each of these needs, offering marketers more confidence that their ads are relevant, safe and suitable. As the programmatic industry evolves it is time to work together to push the creative boundaries for clients and campaigns, and what better place to begin than delivering true marketing outcomes through the power of context.

       "  'content': \"Anyone fearing the UK’s worsening supply crisis would scupper their Christmas dinner should rest assured that turkeys will be available this festive season, the Tory chairman has said.  Oliver Dowden said ensuring the country had enough poultry to see it through to the new year was a priority for the government, as the number of sectors affected by labour shortages continued to grow.  The government hopes that the army of workers brought in from overseas on temporary visas will “save Christmas” but food and haulage industry leaders have been quick to pour cold water on the plans. Speaking to Sky News' Trevor Phillips on Sunday, Mr Dowden insisted there were supply chain problems across the world due to lorry driver shortages, but said issues with turkey production were being addressed. “We will make sure that people have their turkeys for Christmas,” he said. “I know that for the Environment Secretary George Eustice, this is absolutely top of his list.” He added: “We are not unique in the UK in this. If you look across Poland, the US, other countries, there are shortages of drivers – that's to do with a range of factors.” The government’s central response to critics’ complaints of a worsening supply crisis is to insist that the country cannot expect to rely on cheap immigrant labour in future. But at the same time, ministers have announced 5,000 temporary visas to foreign lorry drivers amid warnings of shortages on the shelves in the run-up to Christmas – apparently acknowledging that allowing workers from overseas to come to the UK is a solution to the crisis. Experts have encouraged shoppers to buy Christmas dinner in advance and put it in the freezer if they want to avoid disappointment. “Ultimately, now I think we have just run out of time,” said James Withers, of Scotland Food & Drink. “I don’t think there is anything that can be done now to get the Christmas trade where it should be. “That’s despite warnings being sounded since the summer of the scale of the potential labour shortage we might face.” Mr Withers recommended that people should “plan ahead” and think early about food that could be frozen to avoid disappointment later on.
